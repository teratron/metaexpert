# Research: Crypto Trading Library Implementation

## Unknowns Resolution

### 1. Exchange API Integration Approaches

**Decision**: Use REST API as primary communication method with WebSocket support for real-time data streaming
**Rationale**: REST APIs provide reliable, stateless communication for trading operations while WebSockets offer efficient real-time market data streaming. This combination is widely adopted in the industry and supported by all major exchanges.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Pure REST API (would be inefficient for real-time data)
- Pure WebSocket (doesn't provide the reliability needed for trading operations)
- FIX protocol (overly complex for this use case)

### 2. Authentication Mechanisms for Exchanges

**Decision**: Use API key authentication with HMAC signing for secure API requests
**Rationale**: API key authentication with HMAC signing is the standard security practice among cryptocurrency exchanges. It provides a good balance between security and implementation simplicity.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- OAuth (not commonly used by exchanges)
- JWT tokens (not standard for exchange APIs)
- Basic authentication (insecure for production use)

### 3. Data Storage and Retention Patterns

**Decision**: Use JSON/CSV file storage with configurable retention policies
**Rationale**: File-based storage meets the constitutional requirement for storage while being simple to implement and maintain. Configurable retention policies allow users to balance storage needs with compliance requirements.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- SQLite database (adds complexity without significant benefits)
- PostgreSQL (overkill for individual trader use cases)
- Cloud storage solutions (adds external dependencies)

### 4. Rate Limiting and Request Throttling

**Decision**: Implement token bucket algorithm for rate limiting with exponential backoff
**Rationale**: Token bucket algorithm provides smooth request distribution while allowing burst capacity when needed. Exponential backoff handles temporary service unavailability gracefully.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Simple delay-based throttling (inefficient)
- Leaky bucket algorithm (less flexible for burst scenarios)
- Fixed window counter (can lead to request spikes at window boundaries)

### 5. Error Handling and Retry Logic

**Decision**: Use circuit breaker pattern with retry mechanisms for transient failures
**Rationale**: Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures during service outages while retry mechanisms handle transient network issues. This approach provides resilience without overwhelming services during outages.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Immediate failure propagation (poor user experience)
- Unlimited retries (can overwhelm services)
- Simple timeout-based retries (doesn't distinguish between transient and permanent failures)

### 6. Trading Strategy Implementation Patterns

**Decision**: Use decorator-based approach for strategy definition with event-driven execution
**Rationale**: Decorators provide clean, readable syntax for defining trading strategies while event-driven execution enables responsive trading behavior. This approach aligns with constitutional requirements.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Class-based inheritance (more verbose)
- Function composition (less intuitive for strategy definition)
- Configuration file approach (less flexible for complex strategies)

### 7. Cross-Exchange Order Management

**Decision**: Implement unified order model with exchange-specific adapters
**Rationale**: Unified order model provides consistent interface while adapters handle exchange-specific nuances. This approach maximizes code reuse while accommodating exchange differences.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Exchange-specific order models (code duplication)
- Generic order model with extensive mapping (complex to maintain)
- Direct passthrough to exchange APIs (breaks abstraction)

### 8. Risk Management Implementation

**Decision**: Implement server-side risk controls with client-side validation
**Rationale**: Server-side controls provide authoritative enforcement while client-side validation improves responsiveness. This layered approach ensures risk controls are effective even with network issues.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Server-side only (slower response to risk conditions)
- Client-side only (can be bypassed)
- External risk management service (adds complexity and dependencies)
