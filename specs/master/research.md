# Research Summary for MetaExpert Framework

## Decision: Technology Stack
**Rationale**: Selected Python 3.12+ with uv for dependency management, following the project constitution. This stack ensures maintainability, cross-platform compatibility, and adherence to quality standards (ruff, pyright).

## Decision: Architecture Pattern
**Rationale**: Adopted library-first architecture with CLI interface for all functionality, as mandated by the constitution. This ensures all features are independently testable and properly exposed.

## Decision: Supported Exchanges
**Rationale**: Based on project structure, the framework supports Binance, Bybit, and OKX exchanges. This was determined from the directory structure in the implementation plan template.

## Decision: Testing Strategy  
**Rationale**: Implementation will use pytest with 85% coverage minimum as required by the constitution. Test-driven development approach will be followed with red-green-refactor cycles.

## Decision: Code Quality Standards
**Rationale**: All Python code will adhere to ruff formatting, pyright type annotations, and isort import organization as specified in the constitution.

## Alternatives Considered
- Alternative exchange integrations: Considered additional exchanges but focused on the three mentioned in the template (Binance, Bybit, OKX)
- Alternative architectures: Considered monolithic approaches but chose library-first as required by constitution
- Alternative testing frameworks: Considered unittest but pytest is mandated by constitution
