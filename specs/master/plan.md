# Implementation Plan: MetaExpert Trading Library

**Branch**: `master` | **Date**: 2025-10-09 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/master/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of the MetaExpert trading library with focus on the logger module improvement, providing a unified interface for cryptocurrency exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX) supporting multiple trading types (spot, futures, options) with event-driven architecture and comprehensive risk management features. The logger module will be enhanced to provide structured logging, asynchronous logging, and specialized handlers for different types of log messages.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+  \n**Primary Dependencies**: ccxt (for exchange connectivity), asyncio, logging, typing  \n**Storage**: Files (for state persistence and logging)  \n**Testing**: pytest  \n**Target Platform**: Linux server, Windows, macOS
**Project Type**: Single project - cryptocurrency trading library  \n**Performance Goals**: Sub-100ms event handler execution for real-time market data processing  \n**Constraints**: <200ms p95 API response times, <100MB memory for standard operation, must support live trading with proper error handling and recovery
**Scale/Scope**: Support 3+ major exchanges simultaneously, handle 10,000+ concurrent market data updates, support multiple trading strategies per instance

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Code and documentation language requirements: All code, comments, documentation, variable names, function names, class names, method names, attribute names, and technical terms must be in English
- Communication style: Explanations and discussions in the chat interface should be in Russian for conversational responses and clarifications
- Language compliance: Technical documentation, inline comments, docstrings, and README files must be written in English
- Template management: Ensure any AI agent actions and outputs do not conflict with the structure, parameters, or functionality defined in template.py as required by the constitution
- Cryptocurrency trading focus: Confirm that the implementation aligns with MetaExpert's purpose as a cryptocurrency trading library providing unified interfaces for multiple exchanges
- Multi-exchange support: Verify implementation supports major exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, etc.) as specified in the constitution
- Trading types coverage: Ensure support for all major trading types (spot, futures, margin, options) as required
- Event-driven architecture: Confirm implementation follows the required event-driven approach for trading strategies
- Decorator-based strategy implementation: Verify strategies can be implemented using decorators as specified
- Trading modes support: Check that both paper trading and live trading modes are supported
- Risk management: Confirm comprehensive risk management features are implemented as required
- Documentation management: Ensure documentation in the @/docs directory is updated with every functional change, preserving the existing structure (api, guides, tutorials) and keeping README.md current with functionality descriptions, usage examples, and configuration information
- Version management: Confirm that significant functional changes update the project version according to SemVer conventions in all relevant files (@/pyproject.toml, @/README.md, @/src/metaexpert/__version__.py, @/docs/*, etc.) while considering dependencies, documentation updates, API changes, and backward compatibility
- Project structure compliance: Ensure the implementation follows the required project structure with @/src/metaexpert containing the core library with a modular system where each module handles specific functions (avoid creating model and service modules) and @/examples containing three sample projects that serve as verification material for client developers
- Object-Oriented Programming: Ensure code follows OOP principles including Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction as required by the constitution
- SOLID Design Principles: Verify implementation follows Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion Principles
- DRY Principle: Confirm code elimination of duplication and single source of truth as required by the constitution
- KISS Principle: Verify code maintains simplicity and avoids unnecessary complexity as required by the constitution
- YAGNI Principle: Ensure only currently needed functionality is implemented, not anticipated future needs as required by the constitution
- Feature-Sliced Design: Confirm architectural methodology uses layer-based organization where each feature is implemented as a cohesive slice spanning all necessary layers

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure chosen to implement the cryptocurrency trading library with modular organization. The structure follows the required project layout with @/src/metaexpert containing the core library with a modular system where each module handles specific functions, and @/examples containing sample projects that serve as verification material for client developers.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
