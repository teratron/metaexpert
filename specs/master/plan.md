# Implementation Plan: Crypto Trading Library

**Branch**: `master` | **Date**: 2025-10-08 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/master/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a Python library for cryptocurrency trading that provides a unified interface for multiple exchanges (initially Binance, Bybit, OKX and etc.) and supports various trading options through their respective APIs. The system is designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to use while maintaining high performance and reliability. The library will support spot, futures, options, and margin trading with comprehensive risk management features.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12 or higher (as per constitution)  
**Primary Dependencies**: argparse, logging (standard library), websocket-client, python-dotenv (minimize 3rd-party dependencies per requirements)  
**Storage**: Files (trading data with configurable retention, minimum 3 years as default)  
**Testing**: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov (as per constitution testing standards with minimum 85% coverage)  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
**Project Type**: Single project library  
**Performance Goals**: Support up to 1000+ trades per second per user account, trading operations complete within 2 seconds for 95% of requests (as per spec SC-003 and SC-005)  
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 for simple operations (per constitution), API key authentication for exchanges, full observability (logging, metrics, distributed tracing), maximize use of standard library Python modules  
**Scale/Scope**: Designed for individual traders and algorithmic trading systems, configurable data retention policies

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Code and documentation language requirements: All code, comments, documentation, variable names, function names, class names, method names, attribute names, and technical terms must be in English
- Communication style: Explanations and discussions in the chat interface should be in Russian for conversational responses and clarifications
- Language compliance: Technical documentation, inline comments, docstrings, and README files must be written in English
- Template management: Ensure any AI agent actions and outputs do not conflict with the structure, parameters, or functionality defined in template.py as required by the constitution
- Cryptocurrency trading focus: Confirm that the implementation aligns with MetaExpert's purpose as a cryptocurrency trading library providing unified interfaces for multiple exchanges
- Multi-exchange support: Verify implementation supports major exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, etc.) as specified in the constitution
- Trading types coverage: Ensure support for all major trading types (spot, futures, margin, options) as required
- Event-driven architecture: Confirm implementation follows the required event-driven approach for trading strategies
- Decorator-based strategy implementation: Verify strategies can be implemented using decorators as specified
- Trading modes support: Check that both paper trading and live trading modes are supported
- Risk management: Confirm comprehensive risk management features are implemented as required
- Documentation management: Ensure documentation in the @/docs directory is updated with every functional change, preserving the existing structure (api, guides, tutorials) and keeping README.md current with functionality descriptions, usage examples, and configuration information
- Version management: Confirm that significant functional changes update the project version according to SemVer conventions in all relevant files (@/pyproject.toml, @/README.md, @/src/metaexpert/__version__.py, @/docs/*, etc.) while considering dependencies, documentation updates, API changes, and backward compatibility
- Project structure compliance: Ensure the implementation follows the required project structure with @/src/metaexpert containing the core library with a modular system where each module handles specific functions (avoid creating model and service modules) and @/examples containing three sample projects that serve as verification material for client developers

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
