# Feature Specification: MetaExpert Trading Library

**Feature Branch**: `master`  \n**Created**: 2025-10-09  \n**Status**: Draft  \n**Input**: User description: "Explore and analyze the reference file @/src/metaexpert/template/template.py on the basis of which, as well as taking into account the existing project modules, form a complete project specification, including architectural principles, component structure, design patterns, dependencies, interfaces and conceptual solutions embedded in the architecture."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Configure Trading Expert (Priority: P1)

As a trading expert developer, I want to create a new trading expert with a unified configuration system that supports multiple exchanges, so that I can easily build and deploy trading strategies across different platforms.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that allows users to create trading experts with standardized configuration parameters, which is essential for all other functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new expert instance with different exchange configurations (Binance, Bybit, OKX) and verifying successful initialization with proper API credentials.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to create a new trading expert, **When** they use the MetaExpert constructor with proper parameters, **Then** a configured expert instance is created with the specified exchange connection
2. **Given** a user specifies API credentials, **When** they initialize the expert, **Then** secure authentication is established with the chosen exchange

---

### User Story 2 - Implement Trading Strategy Logic (Priority: P2)

As a trading expert developer, I want to implement event-driven trading logic using standardized event handlers, so that I can execute trading strategies based on market conditions, price ticks, time intervals, and other triggers.

**Why this priority**: After establishing the connection infrastructure, implementing the actual trading logic is the next critical component for a functional trading system.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by implementing a simple strategy in event handlers and verifying the expert responds correctly to market data updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** market data is received, **When** the bar() event handler executes, **Then** the trading logic processes the OHLCV data correctly
2. **Given** an order is placed, **When** the order() event handler executes, **Then** the system properly tracks the order status

---

### User Story 3 - Manage Risk and Position Parameters (Priority: P3)

As a trading expert developer, I want to configure and enforce risk management parameters like stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing, so that my trading strategies follow predefined safety measures.

**Why this priority**: Risk management is critical for successful trading, and having these features available ensures strategies can operate safely across different market conditions.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring risk parameters and verifying that the expert enforces these limits during trading execution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** stop-loss and take-profit parameters are set, **When** a trade is executed, **Then** these parameters are applied to the position as configured
2. **Given** a position reaches stop-loss level, **When** the position() event handler executes, **Then** the position is closed according to strategy rules

---

### User Story 4 - Support Multiple Trading Modes and Asset Types (Priority: P4)

As a trading expert developer, I want to support different trading modes (paper, live, backtest) and asset types (spot, futures, options), so that I can thoroughly test strategies before going live and trade different market instruments.

**Why this priority**: Flexibility in trading modes ensures proper strategy validation, while support for different asset types increases the library's utility.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the same strategy in different modes (paper, live, backtest) and with different market types (spot vs futures).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trading strategy, **When** it's executed in paper mode, **Then** it simulates trades without real money movement
2. **Given** a futures strategy, **When** it's executed, **Then** it properly handles futures-specific parameters like leverage and contract types

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when exchange API rate limits are reached during active trading?
- How does the system handle network timeouts during trade execution?
- What occurs when the configured leverage exceeds exchange limits for a specific symbol?
- How does the system handle conflicting position modes during strategy changes?
- What happens when historical data is insufficient for the specified lookback period?
