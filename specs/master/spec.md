# Feature Specification: Crypto Trading Library

**Feature Branch**: `master`  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Connect to Multiple Exchanges (Priority: P1)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to connect to multiple exchanges through a unified interface so that I can execute trades across different platforms without dealing with different APIs.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the library - providing a unified interface across multiple exchanges, which is the primary functionality that differentiates the product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting to at least two different exchanges (e.g., Binance, Bybit) using the same interface and performing basic operations like fetching account balances or placing orders.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trader wants to trade on multiple exchanges, **When** they use the library's unified interface, **Then** they can connect to different exchanges using the same method signatures and data structures
2. **Given** an existing trading strategy, **When** they want to switch between exchanges, **Then** they can do so with minimal code changes

### User Story 2 - Execute Different Trading Types (Priority: P2)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to perform different types of trading (spot, futures, options, margin) using the same library so that I can diversify my trading strategy and manage all my positions in one place.

**Why this priority**: Once the core unified interface across exchanges is established, supporting multiple trading types becomes essential for comprehensive trading capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by performing different trading operations (spot trading, futures trading) using the same library interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to trade spot markets, **When** they use the library, **Then** they can execute spot trades across supported exchanges using the same API
2. **Given** a user wants to trade futures contracts, **When** they use the library, **Then** they can execute futures trades with appropriate contract types (USDⓈ-M vs COIN-M for futures)

### User Story 3 - Implement Risk Management Features (Priority: P3)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to set up stop-loss, take-profit, and trailing-stop parameters via the library so that I can implement automated risk management across my trading activities.

**Why this priority**: Risk management is critical for successful trading, and having these features available across all supported exchanges increases the library's value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting up risk management parameters and verifying they are properly applied to trades across exchanges.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trader wants to set risk parameters, **When** they configure stop-loss, take-profit, or trailing-stop values, **Then** these parameters are applied consistently across all exchange interactions

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an exchange API is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system handle network timeouts during trading operations?
- How does the system handle rate limits imposed by exchanges?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a unified interface that abstracts differences between cryptocurrency exchanges
- **FR-002**: System MUST support at least three major cryptocurrency exchanges (Binance, Bybit, and others that may be added)
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to perform spot trading operations (buy/sell orders) across supported exchanges
- **FR-004**: System MUST support multiple trading types including spot, futures, options, and margin trading
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to set stop-loss, take-profit, and trailing-stop parameters for trades
- **FR-008**: All code, comments, documentation, variable names, function names, class names, method names, and attribute names MUST be in English to ensure readability and maintainability
- **FR-009**: Technical documentation, inline comments, and docstrings MUST be written in English
- **FR-010**: System MUST support both USDⓈ-M and COIN-M futures contract types for exchanges that offer futures trading
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide access to trading parameters like position size, timeframes, and trading pairs across all supported exchanges
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to backtest, paper trade, and execute live trades through the same interface with only mode configuration changes
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain consistent data models and method signatures across all supported exchange integrations
- **FR-014**: System MUST support real-time market data streaming from all integrated exchanges
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide account balance and position information in a unified format across exchanges

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Exchange**: Represents a cryptocurrency exchange (Binance, Bybit, etc.) with its own API endpoints, rate limits, and features
- **TradingInstrument**: Represents a tradeable asset pair (e.g., BTCUSDT) with specific properties and trading rules
- **Order**: Represents a trading instruction (buy/sell) with parameters like type, size, price, stop-loss, take-profit, etc.
- **Position**: Represents an open trading position with current value, profit/loss, and risk parameters
- **TradingAccount**: Represents a user's account on a specific exchange with balances, permissions, and configurations

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can execute trades on at least 3 different exchanges using the same method calls with 99% success rate
- **SC-002**: Switching between trading types (spot to futures) requires less than 5 lines of code changes in user applications
- **SC-003**: Trading operations complete within 2 seconds for 95% of requests under normal network conditions
- **SC-004**: Users report 80% higher efficiency in managing multi-exchange trading compared to using exchange-specific APIs directly
