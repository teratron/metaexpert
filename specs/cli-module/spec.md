# Feature Specification: CLI Module for MetaExpert

**Feature Branch**: `cli-module`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a @/src/metaexpert/cli module for the project with a full implementation of the command-line interface, including argument parsing, input data validation, flag and option processing, and a help and help system"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create New Trading Strategy (Priority: P1)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to create a new trading strategy from a template using the command line so that I can quickly set up a working strategy without manually writing boilerplate code.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary value proposition of the CLI - enabling traders to rapidly bootstrap new trading strategies with proper configuration and event handlers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `metaexpert new my_strategy` and verifying that a properly structured strategy file is created with all required configuration options and event handlers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to create a new strategy, **When** they run `metaexpert new my_strategy`, **Then** a new Python file is created with all required template structure and default configuration
2. **Given** a user specifies exchange and symbol options, **When** they run `metaexpert new my_strategy --exchange binance --symbol BTCUSDT`, **Then** the generated strategy file includes those specific configurations

---

### User Story 2 - Run Existing Trading Strategy (Priority: P2)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to run an existing trading strategy from the command line so that I can execute my strategies in different modes (paper, live, backtest) without modifying the code.

**Why this priority**: Running strategies is the core functionality that makes the library useful - it enables actual strategy execution.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a strategy with `metaexpert new` and then running `metaexpert run my_strategy.py --mode paper` to verify the strategy can be executed in paper trading mode.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing strategy file, **When** a user runs `metaexpert run strategy.py --mode paper`, **Then** the strategy executes in paper trading mode with simulated trades
2. **Given** a strategy with backtest parameters, **When** a user runs `metaexpert run strategy.py --mode backtest --backtest-start 2024-01-01 --backtest-end 2024-12-31`, **Then** the strategy runs in backtest mode with the specified date range

---

### User Story 3 - List Available Trading Strategies (Priority: P3)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to list all available trading strategies in a directory so that I can easily discover and manage my existing strategies.

**Why this priority**: Discovery and management of existing strategies is important for users who maintain multiple strategies.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating several strategies and then running `metaexpert list` to verify all strategies are displayed in a readable format.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple strategy files in a directory, **When** a user runs `metaexpert list`, **Then** all strategy files are displayed with clear formatting
2. **Given** a directory with mixed file types, **When** a user runs `metaexpert list`, **Then** only Python files that appear to be strategy files are displayed

---

### User Story 4 - Validate Trading Strategy Files (Priority: P4)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to validate my trading strategy files for syntax and structure errors so that I can catch issues before running potentially broken strategies.

**Why this priority**: Validation helps prevent runtime errors and ensures strategies conform to the expected structure.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a valid strategy and an invalid strategy, then running `metaexpert validate strategy.py` to verify proper validation feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a syntactically correct strategy file, **When** a user runs `metaexpert validate strategy.py`, **Then** the system confirms the file is valid
2. **Given** a strategy file with syntax errors, **When** a user runs `metaexpert validate strategy.py`, **Then** the system identifies and reports the specific errors

---

### User Story 5 - Access Help and Documentation (Priority: P5)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to access comprehensive help and documentation from the command line so that I can understand how to use all CLI features without referring to external documentation.

**Why this priority**: Good help systems improve usability and reduce friction for users learning the tool.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running `metaexpert --help` and `metaexpert new --help` to verify comprehensive help text is displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user unfamiliar with the CLI, **When** they run `metaexpert --help`, **Then** they see a clear overview of all available commands with descriptions
2. **Given** a user wanting details about a specific command, **When** they run `metaexpert new --help`, **Then** they see detailed help for that command including all options and usage examples

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user specifies an invalid exchange name?
- How does the system handle missing required arguments?
- What happens when the output directory doesn't exist or isn't writable?
- How does the system handle strategy files with syntax errors during execution?
- What happens when date formats are incorrect for backtesting?
