# Implementation Plan: Comprehensive Logging System

**Branch**: `001-logging-system-spec` | **Date**: 2025-10-17 | **Spec**: [link to spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-logging-system-spec/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a comprehensive logging system for MetaExpert that satisfies the requirements for structured logging, performance, and flexibility. The system uses structlog as the core technology with asynchronous capabilities, RFC 5424 compliant JSON formatting, and specialized file handling for different log types (general, trade, error). The design follows the library-first architecture with Pydantic for configuration and supports multiple configuration methods.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12 (as specified in project requirements)  
**Primary Dependencies**: structlog (for structured logging), Pydantic (for configuration models), asyncio (for asynchronous operations), rotatingfilehandler (for log rotation)  
**Storage**: File-based logging with rotation to local storage  
**Testing**: pytest (as per MetaExpert Constitution)  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform Python environment (Windows, Linux, macOS)  
**Project Type**: Library-first architecture with CLI exposure  
**Performance Goals**: Individual log operations complete within 10ms; system supports 10,000 entries per second with asynchronous logging enabled without blocking the main trading thread  
**Constraints**: <10ms p95 for individual log operations, must maintain trading performance in live environments, must continue operation even when logging system fails  
**Scale/Scope**: Designed to support multiple concurrent trading experts, each potentially generating thousands of log entries per second

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Gates determined based on MetaExpert Constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`:

- **Library-First Architecture**: PASS - Logging system will be implemented as a standalone library with clear API
- **CLI Interface**: PASS - Functionality will be exposed via CLI through the existing MetaExpert CLI interface
- **Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: PASS - Comprehensive test coverage planned with pytest (unit, integration, end-to-end tests)
- **Integration Testing**: PASS - Integration tests planned for logger configuration, file output, and async operation
- **UI Consistency**: N/A - Backend library functionality, no UI component
- **Development Conventions**: PASS - Will adhere to OOP, SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, and FSD principles

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project following the library-first architecture pattern. Logging system will be implemented as a dedicated module within the metaexpert package with proper separation of concerns. The structure mirrors the specification's architectural requirements and follows the established MetaExpert project patterns.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
