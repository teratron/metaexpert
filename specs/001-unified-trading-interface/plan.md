# Implementation Plan: Unified Trading Interface

**Branch**: `feature/001-unified-trading-interface` | **Date**: 2025-10-12 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-unified-trading-interface/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan details the creation of a unified trading interface for MetaExpert. This core architectural feature will provide a consistent abstraction layer for interacting with multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. It will define a set of standard interfaces and data models using **Pydantic** to ensure type safety and data integrity for all trading entities. The primary goal is to allow developers to write trading strategies once and deploy them across any supported exchange.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+
**Primary Dependencies**: Pydantic
**Storage**: N/A (This feature defines interfaces, not storage)
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Python Library
**Project Type**: Library core/interface
**Performance Goals**: Sub-100ms latency for order execution.
**Constraints**: The interface must be extensible to allow for new exchanges to be added easily, following a plugin-like architecture.
**Scale/Scope**: This is a large-scale architectural feature that will be the foundation for the entire library.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Library-first architecture**: PASS. This is the core library interface.
- **CLI Interface**: N/A. This feature is not user-facing via the CLI.
- **Test-first approach**: PASS. The plan includes defining interfaces and then testing implementations against them.
- **Integration testing**: PASS. Contract tests for the interfaces are a core part of this feature.
- **UI Consistency**: N/A.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: PASS. A clear performance target is defined.
- **Quality Maintenance**: PASS. `ruff` and `pyright` will be used.
- **SOLID Principles**: PASS. This feature is a direct application of the Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion principles.
- **DRY Principle**: PASS. The goal is to eliminate repeated logic for each exchange.
- **KISS Principle**: PASS. A single, simple interface is the goal.
- **YAGNI Principle**: PASS. Only the core trading entities and functions will be defined initially.
- **FSD Principle**: N/A.
- **OOP Principle**: PASS. The feature will be built on abstract base classes and data models.
- **Python Code Quality**: PASS. Mandated by the project constitution.
- **Documentation Requirements**: PASS. Plan includes creating a developer quickstart.
- **Versioning Requirements**: DEFERRED. Version will be updated during implementation.
- **Template File Requirements**: N/A.
- **Rule Validation**: PASS.

**Result**: All gates pass. No complexity justification is required.

```

### Source Code (repository root)

The implementation will add/modify the following files:

```
src/metaexpert/
└── core/                    # Core system - main components
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── enums.py             # NEW: For all shared enumerations (OrderStatus, OrderType, etc.).
    ├── models.py            # NEW: For all Pydantic data models (Order, Trade, Ticker, etc.).
    └── interfaces.py        # NEW: For all abstract interfaces (IExchange, IStrategy, etc.).

tests/
├── contract/
│   └── test_interfaces.py # NEW: Tests to ensure implementations adhere to contracts.
└── unit/
    └── test_models.py       # NEW: Unit tests for Pydantic model validation and logic.
```

**Structure Decision**: The new unified interfaces and data models are core to the entire library. Therefore, they will be placed in a new set of files within the `src/metaexpert/core/` directory. This keeps the fundamental contracts of the system centrally located and clearly separated from exchange-specific implementations.

## Complexity Tracking

No complexity tracking needed as no constitutional violations were identified.
