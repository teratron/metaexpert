# Feature Specification: MetaExpert Unified Trading Interface

**Feature Branch**: `feature/unified-trading-interface`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "MetaExpert is a library designed for cryptocurrency trading that provides a unified interface for multiple exchanges (initially Binance, Bybit, OKX and etc.) and supports various trading options through their respective APIs. The library aims to simplify algorithmic trading by providing a consistent interface while maintaining access to exchange-specific features. The system must: create a unified interface for multiple cryptocurrency exchanges; support all major trading types (spot, futures, margin, options and etc.) through exchange APIs; provide an event-driven architecture for trading strategies; enable easy strategy implementation through decorators; support paper trading and live trading modes; and implement comprehensive risk management features."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Unified Exchange Connection (Priority: P1)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to connect to multiple exchanges through a single, consistent interface so that I can manage my trading activities across different platforms without learning multiple APIs.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other features. Without a unified interface, the entire value proposition of the library fails.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting to at least one exchange, performing basic operations (fetch balances, place orders), and verifying the same operations work with minimal code changes for other supported exchanges.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** trader has API credentials for supported exchanges, **When** they initialize the library with exchange parameters, **Then** the library provides a consistent interface regardless of the exchange
2. **Given** trader is connected to an exchange, **When** they request account balance, **Then** the response format is consistent across all supported exchanges

### User Story 2 - Multi-Exchange Trading (Priority: P2)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to execute trades on multiple exchanges simultaneously to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities and diversify my trading strategies across different platforms.

**Why this priority**: This provides the core value of the library by enabling cross-platform trading, which is essential for sophisticated trading operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing trades on at least two different exchanges in parallel and verifying successful execution on both platforms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** trader has accounts on multiple exchanges, **When** they place an order on one exchange, **Then** the order is processed according to the exchange's rules and returns consistent status information
2. **Given** trader wants to execute orders across exchanges, **When** they submit orders to multiple exchanges simultaneously, **Then** each order is handled independently without affecting the others

---

### User Story 3 - Trading Strategy Implementation (Priority: P3)

As a trading algorithm developer, I want to implement trading strategies using simplified programming patterns so that I can quickly develop and deploy algorithmic trading approaches without getting bogged down in implementation details.

**Why this priority**: This enables the algorithmic trading capabilities that differentiate the library from simple API wrappers, making it more attractive to professional traders.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a simple trading strategy using simplified programming patterns, running it against market data, and verifying that the strategy executes trades according to its logic.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer has created a trading strategy using simplified programming patterns, **When** market conditions match the strategy rules, **Then** the strategy automatically executes the predefined trading actions
2. **Given** a running trading strategy, **When** market data changes, **Then** the strategy is triggered to evaluate and potentially execute trades

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an exchange API is temporarily unavailable during live trading?
- How does the system handle insufficient balance for executing an order?
- What occurs when market conditions change rapidly during order execution across different exchanges?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: What specific risk management features are essential for the initial MVP? → A: Full suite: stop-loss, take-profit, trailing stops, loss limits.
- Q: What specific mechanism should be used for storing and accessing API keys? → A: Environment variables for dev, cloud secret manager for prod.
- Q: Where and for how long should trading history data be stored? → A: Local SQLite DB, indefinitely.
- Q: What features are explicitly out of scope for this version? → A: UI and mobile support.
- Q: What is the required system behavior when an exchange API fails? → A: Pause for failed exchange, retry connection.
- Q: For the unified interface, should the library normalize all exchange-specific data models to use standard fields and types? → A: Normalize all exchange data to standard fields and types.
- Q: What are the specific requirements for handling rate limits across different exchanges? → A: per-exchange rate limiting with different strategies.
- Q: For the event-driven architecture, what specific events should trigger strategy execution? → A: Custom events based on strategy requirements.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly out of scope for the current version:

- A graphical user interface (UI).
- Support for mobile platforms.

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a unified interface for connecting to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX initially)
- **FR-002**: System MUST support all major trading types (spot, futures, margin, options) through exchange APIs
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to execute trades across multiple exchanges simultaneously
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement an event-driven architecture for trading strategies with custom events based on strategy requirements
- **FR-005**: System MUST enable simple strategy implementation using patterns that reduce complexity
- **FR-006**: System MUST support both paper trading and live trading modes
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement a comprehensive suite of risk management features, including stop-loss, take-profit, trailing stops, and position/daily loss limits.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide consistent data formats across all supported exchanges
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle exchange-specific API rate limits and connection management with per-exchange rate limiting strategies
- **FR-010**: System MUST support real-time market data streaming from multiple exchanges
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide order management capabilities (place, cancel, modify orders)
- **FR-012**: System MUST include portfolio tracking and performance metrics across all exchanges
- **FR-013**: System MUST support different account types (spot, futures, margin) on each exchange
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide secure API key management, using environment variables for local development and a cloud secret manager for production environments.
- **FR-015**: System MUST automatically attempt to reconnect to an exchange if the API becomes unavailable, pausing trading for that exchange until the connection is restored.
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain trading history and transaction records indefinitely in a local SQLite database.
