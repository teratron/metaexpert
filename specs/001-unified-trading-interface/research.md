# Research: Data Validation Library Selection

**Task**: Research and select a data validation and contract library for defining the unified trading models (Order, Ticker, Trade, etc.).

## Decision

We will use **Pydantic** to define all data transfer objects and entities within the unified trading interface.

## Rationale

- **Runtime Data Validation**: The core requirement of the unified interface is to consume data from multiple external, untrusted sources (exchange APIs) and normalize it. Pydantic enforces data contracts at runtime, ensuring that all data conforms to a strict, unified model. This is critical for preventing bugs and errors caused by unexpected or malformed API responses.
- **Ecosystem Standard**: Pydantic is the de-facto standard for data validation in the modern Python ecosystem, particularly for APIs and systems that interact with external data. Its widespread adoption ensures a large community, extensive documentation, and proven reliability.
- **Clear Error Reporting**: When validation fails, Pydantic provides clear, detailed error messages that pinpoint exactly which data field is incorrect. This is invaluable for debugging issues with exchange APIs.
- **Complex Data Structures**: It seamlessly handles complex, nested data structures, which are common in the order book, ticker, and trade data returned by exchanges.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Standard `dataclasses`**: This built-in module is excellent for creating simple data classes but lacks runtime validation. For a system that depends on the integrity of external data, this is a significant drawback.
- **`attrs`**: A mature and powerful library for creating classes. While it has some validation capabilities, Pydantic's primary focus is on parsing and validation, making it a more specialized and better-suited tool for this specific problem.
