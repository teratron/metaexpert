# Research: Unified Trading Interface Implementation

**Feature**: MetaExpert Unified Trading Interface
**Date**: 2025-10-13

## Overview

This research document addresses the technical unknowns and decisions required for implementing the unified trading interface for MetaExpert.

## Decision: Exchange API Integration Pattern
**Rationale**: To provide a unified interface across multiple exchanges, we need to abstract exchange-specific implementations behind a common interface. The adapter pattern is ideal for this, allowing each exchange to implement the same interface while handling their unique API requirements.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Direct API calls without abstraction (rejected - would create tight coupling)
- Plugin architecture (rejected - overkill for initial implementation)

## Decision: Event-Driven Architecture Implementation
**Rationale**: For real-time trading, an event-driven system is essential. Using an observer pattern with Pydantic models for events will ensure type safety and consistency across different event types (ticks, bars, orders, positions, etc). This allows for flexible strategy implementation with custom events as required.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Polling-based architecture (rejected - inefficient and introduces latency)
- Message queues (rejected - overcomplicates for single-instance trading)

## Decision: Data Normalization Approach
**Rationale**: According to the clarification session, all exchange-specific data models should be normalized to standard fields and types. This will be achieved through Pydantic models that map exchange-specific data to unified formats. This ensures consistency across all exchanges as required by FR-018.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Maintaining exchange-specific variations (rejected - contradicts specified requirements)
- Partial normalization (rejected - would still lead to inconsistencies)

## Decision: Rate Limiting Strategy
**Rationale**: As clarified in the requirements, per-exchange rate limiting with different strategies is required. This will be implemented using a decorator-based approach with exchange-specific rate limit configurations. Each exchange implementation will track its own rate limits independently.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Global rate limiting (rejected - doesn't account for exchange-specific limits)
- No rate limiting (rejected - would violate exchange terms of service)

## Decision: Order Management System
**Rationale**: The unified interface needs to handle order placement, cancellation, and modification consistently across exchanges. This will be implemented using a command pattern where each operation is represented as a command object that can be executed against any exchange.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Exchange-specific order operations (rejected - would break interface consistency)
- Simplified synchronous model (rejected - doesn't handle exchange-specific processing delays)

## Decision: Risk Management Implementation
**Rationale**: Risk management features (stop-loss, take-profit, trailing stops, etc.) will be built into the core system with exchange-agnostic logic. Each exchange will implement the specific order types required for these features, maintaining consistency in how risk management is configured and applied.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Exchange-specific risk management (rejected - would create inconsistent user experience)
- No risk management (rejected - core requirement)

## Decision: Backtesting Capability
**Rationale**: The system needs to support both paper trading and live trading as specified in FR-006. This will be achieved by implementing a mode selector that determines whether operations actually execute on exchanges or simulate for paper trading. Historical data will be used for backtesting, requiring integration with data providers.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Separate backtesting system (rejected - would duplicate trading logic)
- Live-trading only (rejected - doesn't meet requirements)

## Decision: API Version Compatibility
**Rationale**: As per the new constitution principle, we need to specify minimum compatible API versions for exchanges. This will be documented in the exchange-specific modules and README files. The system will handle version differences through adapter methods that normalize responses to the unified interface.
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Using latest API versions only (rejected - would limit compatibility)
- No version tracking (rejected - violates constitution principle)
