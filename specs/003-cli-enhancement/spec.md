# Feature Specification: MetaExpert CLI System Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `003-cli-enhancement`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Review the existing command-line interface system in src/metaexpert/_argument.py within the MetaExpert project, then fix, improve, optimize, and refactor it, and alignment with the template.py structure, while optimizing performance and maintainability."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user strategies"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the MetaExpert library, I want an improved command-line interface that is well-organized, easy to use, and aligned with the template structure so that I can efficiently configure and run my trading strategies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer wants to create a new trading strategy, **When** they run the `metaexpert new` command with various options, **Then** the command executes successfully and creates a properly configured template.
2. **Given** a developer wants to run a trading strategy, **When** they use command-line arguments to configure the strategy, **Then** the arguments are properly parsed and applied to the strategy execution.
3. **Given** a developer is troubleshooting a strategy, **When** they use help commands, **Then** they receive clear, organized documentation about available options.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when conflicting command-line arguments are provided?
- How does the system handle invalid argument values?
- What happens when required arguments are missing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a well-organized command-line interface with logical grouping of options.
- **FR-002**: System MUST align command-line arguments with template.py configuration parameters.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide comprehensive help documentation for all command-line options.
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle invalid arguments gracefully with clear error messages.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support both short and long-form argument names where appropriate.
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing command-line usage.
- **FR-007**: System MUST optimize argument parsing performance for fast startup times.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide validation for argument values where constraints exist.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **CommandLineArgument**: A command-line option with name, type, default value, and validation rules.
- **ArgumentGroup**: A logical grouping of related command-line arguments.
- **ArgumentParser**: A component responsible for parsing command-line arguments and validating them.
- **HelpDocumentation**: User-facing documentation for command-line options and usage.
