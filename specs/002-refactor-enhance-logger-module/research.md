# Research: Modernizing the Logger Module

**Task**: Research best practices for refactoring and enhancing the existing logger, focusing on performance, structured logging, and maintainability, while preserving its core asynchronous concept and public API.

## Decision

The refactoring will be centered around integrating the **`structlog`** library as a pre-processor for the existing standard `logging` module. The core asynchronous mechanism using `logging.handlers.QueueHandler` will be preserved.

## Rationale

- **Preserves Core Concept**: `structlog` is designed to wrap and enhance the standard `logging` module, not replace it. This allows us to keep the existing asynchronous `QueueHandler` concept, fulfilling a key requirement from the specification.
- **Structured Logging**: It introduces structured, context-aware logging (e.g., JSON output). This is a major enhancement that makes logs machine-readable and vastly easier to parse, query, and analyze in production environments.
- **API Compatibility**: `structlog` can be configured to be a drop-in replacement for the standard logger, which helps in preserving the existing public API and minimizing changes for end-users.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: It provides a simple `bind()` mechanism for adding persistent context to log entries (e.g., `logger.bind(strategy_name="MyStrategy")`), which is a significant improvement over the standard library's `extra` dictionary.
- **Performance**: `structlog` is designed with performance in mind. Its processing pipeline is highly configurable and efficient, ensuring it will not introduce a performance bottleneck.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Refactor without New Dependencies**: This would involve a pure code cleanup of the existing module. This option was rejected because it would fail to deliver a significant enhancement and would not align with the goal to "bring it to perfection."
- **Replace with `Loguru`**: `Loguru` offers a simplified logging API. This was rejected because it would require replacing the entire module and its core concepts, violating the strict requirements to preserve the existing API and design.
