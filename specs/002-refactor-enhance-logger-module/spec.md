# Feature Specification: Refactor and Enhance Logger Module

**Feature Branch**: `feature/refactor-enhance-logger-module`  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "изучи текущее состояния модуля @src/metaexpert/logger/, проверь, доведи до совершенства, но надо оставить данную концепцию модуля"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11
- Q: How should the logger handle I/O errors (e.g., disk full) when it fails to write a log message? → A: Log to a fallback

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Experience (Priority: P1)

As a developer using the `metaexpert` library, I want the logger module to be highly performant and have a clean, understandable API, so that I can easily integrate and rely on it without performance bottlenecks or confusion.

**Why this priority**: The logger is a core utility. A poor developer experience or performance issues will negatively impact all library users.

**Independent Test**: The public API of the logger can be reviewed for clarity and ease of use. Performance benchmarks can be run to validate its efficiency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer needs to add logging to their application, **When** they consult the logger module's API, **Then** they can configure and use it in under 5 minutes.
2. **Given** an application is logging 1000 messages, **When** the logger is active, **Then** the application's overhead is not increased by more than 5% compared to no logging.

### User Story 2 - Maintainer Confidence (Priority: P2)

As a contributor to the `metaexpert` project, I want the logger module's internal code to be well-structured, thoroughly tested, and follow modern best practices, so that I can maintain and extend it with confidence.

**Why this priority**: High internal quality reduces the cost of maintenance and the risk of introducing new bugs.

**Independent Test**: The module can be analyzed with static analysis tools, and code coverage reports can be generated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contributor opens the logger module's source code, **When** they read the code, **Then** the structure is logical and functions are clearly named and documented.
2. **Given** a change is proposed to the logger module, **When** the test suite is run, **Then** it provides clear feedback on any regressions with over 95% coverage.

### Edge Cases

- How does the logger behave under extremely high frequency logging (e.g., thousands of messages per second)? The logger MUST handle at least 10,000 messages per second on standard server hardware (4-core CPU, 8GB RAM) without blocking or dropping messages.
- If a logging destination fails (e.g., due to a disk full error), the logger MUST attempt to write the error message to a fallback destination (stderr) within 100ms.
- How does the logger handle structured log data with invalid characters or non-serializable objects? The logger MUST gracefully handle or sanitize non-serializable objects before logging.
- How does the logger behave during system resource exhaustion (CPU, memory)? The logger MUST not cause additional system instability when resources are low.
- How does the logger handle extremely large log messages that exceed buffer limits? The logger MUST truncate messages larger than 1MB with appropriate warning.
- How does the logger handle concurrent logging from multiple threads/processes? The logger MUST handle concurrent access safely without data corruption.
- How does the logger handle malformed JSON in structured log fields? The logger MUST validate and sanitize JSON fields before output.
- How does the logger handle clock synchronization issues in timestamp generation? The logger MUST use monotonic clocks where possible to maintain accurate timestamps.
- How does the logger handle logger configuration race conditions? The logger MUST prevent race conditions during initialization.
- How does the logger handle circular references in structured log context? The logger MUST detect and handle circular references without crashing.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The existing public interface of the logger module MUST be preserved to ensure backward compatibility. This includes maintaining the `get_logger()` function signature and all standard logging methods (debug, info, warning, error, critical, exception).
- **FR-002**: The internal implementation of the logger module MUST be reviewed and refactored to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability according to modern Python standards (SOLID principles, DRY, KISS) and constitution requirements (ruff formatting, pyright type validation, proper documentation). The refactored code MUST have reduced cyclomatic complexity and improved function cohesion.
- **FR-003**: The refactored logger MUST NOT introduce any performance regressions compared to the current implementation. Performance benchmarks MUST show no more than 5% deviation in message throughput and latency.
- **FR-004**: Code coverage for the logger module MUST be increased to a minimum of 95% as measured by `pytest-cov`.
- **FR-005**: The logger's core design concept (e.g., asynchronous handling, formatting approach) MUST be maintained. The existing `QueueHandler` mechanism MUST be preserved and integrated with the new `structlog` processors.
- **FR-006**: The logger MUST attempt to write to a fallback destination (`stderr`) if the primary logging target is unavailable or encounters an I/O error. The fallback mechanism MUST be resilient and not cause additional failures.
- **FR-007**: The logger MUST support structured logging with JSON output that conforms to the schema defined in data-model.md.
- **FR-008**: The logger MUST support context binding through a `bind()` method that persists contextual information across multiple log calls.
- **FR-009**: The logger MUST support both legacy `extra` dictionary approach and new structured logging parameters for backward compatibility.
- **FR-010**: The logger MUST provide reliable performance even under high-frequency logging scenarios (at least 10,000 messages per second on standard hardware).
- **FR-011**: The logger MUST support consumer configuration of log level, output format, and destination through the existing configuration mechanisms.
- **FR-012**: The logger MUST handle and log exceptions appropriately using the `log.exception()` method when called from exception contexts.
- **FR-013**: Log rotation requirements are explicitly deferred to a future enhancement; the current implementation will rely on external log rotation tools.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Cyclomatic complexity of key functions/methods in the logger module is reduced by at least 20% from the current baseline, as measured by the `mccabe` tool.
- **SC-002**: Unit test coverage for the `src/metaexpert/logger/` module is measured at or above 95% using `pytest-cov`.
- **SC-003**: Benchmark tests (measuring message throughput and latency) show no more than a 5% negative deviation in performance compared to the pre-refactoring version, measured on standard server hardware (4-core CPU, 8GB RAM) with 10,000 log messages per test run.
- **SC-004**: The refactored code passes all configured static analysis checks (e.g., `ruff`, `pyright`) with zero errors or warnings.
