# Feature Specification: Refactor and Enhance Logger Module

**Feature Branch**: `feature/refactor-enhance-logger-module`  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "изучи текущее состояния модуля @src/metaexpert/logger/, проверь, доведи до совершенства, но надо оставить данную концепцию модуля"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11
- Q: How should the logger handle I/O errors (e.g., disk full) when it fails to write a log message? → A: Log to a fallback

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Experience (Priority: P1)

As a developer using the `metaexpert` library, I want the logger module to be highly performant and have a clean, understandable API, so that I can easily integrate and rely on it without performance bottlenecks or confusion.

**Why this priority**: The logger is a core utility. A poor developer experience or performance issues will negatively impact all library users.

**Independent Test**: The public API of the logger can be reviewed for clarity and ease of use. Performance benchmarks can be run to validate its efficiency.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer needs to add logging to their application, **When** they consult the logger module's API, **Then** they can configure and use it in under 5 minutes.
2. **Given** an application is logging 1000 messages, **When** the logger is active, **Then** the application's overhead is not increased by more than 5% compared to no logging.

### User Story 2 - Maintainer Confidence (Priority: P2)

As a contributor to the `metaexpert` project, I want the logger module's internal code to be well-structured, thoroughly tested, and follow modern best practices, so that I can maintain and extend it with confidence.

**Why this priority**: High internal quality reduces the cost of maintenance and the risk of introducing new bugs.

**Independent Test**: The module can be analyzed with static analysis tools, and code coverage reports can be generated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a contributor opens the logger module's source code, **When** they read the code, **Then** the structure is logical and functions are clearly named and documented.
2. **Given** a change is proposed to the logger module, **When** the test suite is run, **Then** it provides clear feedback on any regressions with over 95% coverage.

### Edge Cases

- How does the logger behave under extremely high frequency logging (e.g., thousands of messages per second)?
- If a logging destination fails (e.g., due to a disk full error), the logger MUST attempt to write the error message to a fallback destination (stderr).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The existing public interface of the logger module MUST be preserved to ensure backward compatibility.
- **FR-002**: The internal implementation of the logger module MUST be reviewed and refactored to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability according to modern Python standards.
- **FR-003**: The refactored logger MUST NOT introduce any performance regressions compared to the current implementation.
- **FR-004**: Code coverage for the logger module MUST be increased to a minimum of 95%.
- **FR-005**: The logger's core design concept (e.g., asynchronous handling, formatting approach) MUST be maintained.
- **FR-006**: The logger MUST attempt to write to a fallback destination (`stderr`) if the primary logging target is unavailable or encounters an I/O error.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Cyclomatic complexity of key functions/methods in the logger module is reduced by at least 20% from the current baseline.
- **SC-002**: Unit test coverage for the `src/metaexpert/logger/` module is measured at or above 95%.
- **SC-003**: Benchmark tests (measuring message throughput and latency) show no more than a 5% negative deviation in performance compared to the pre-refactoring version.
- **SC-004**: The refactored code passes all configured static analysis checks (e.g., `ruff`, `pyright`) with zero errors or warnings.
