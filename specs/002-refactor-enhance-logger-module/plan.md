# Implementation Plan: Logger Module Refactor

**Branch**: `feature/002-refactor-enhance-logger-module` | **Date**: 2025-10-12 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/002-refactor-enhance-logger-module/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the refactoring and enhancement of the MetaExpert logger module. The core of the refactor will be the integration of the **`structlog`** library to provide structured, context-aware logging. The existing asynchronous architecture based on the standard `logging` module's `QueueHandler` will be preserved, as will the public-facing API, to ensure backward compatibility while significantly improving the module's capabilities and maintainability.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+
**Primary Dependencies**: structlog
**Storage**: Filesystem (for log files)
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Python Library
**Project Type**: Library core module
**Performance Goals**: No more than 5% performance deviation from the current implementation.
**Constraints**: Must preserve the existing public API and the core asynchronous `QueueHandler` concept.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Library-first architecture**: PASS. The logger is a core, self-contained library component.
- **CLI Interface**: N/A.
- **Test-first approach**: PASS. The plan includes adding comprehensive tests to reach 95% coverage before completing the refactor.
- **Integration testing**: N/A.
- **UI Consistency**: N/A.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: PASS. A clear performance goal is a key requirement.
- **Quality Maintenance**: PASS. The goal of the refactor is to improve code quality.
- **SOLID Principles**: PASS. The refactor will improve the separation of concerns between log processing (`structlog`) and log handling (`logging`).
- **DRY Principle**: PASS.
- **KISS Principle**: PASS. `structlog` simplifies the process of creating structured logs.
- **YAGNI Principle**: PASS.
- **FSD Principle**: N/A.
- **OOP Principle**: PASS.
- **Python Code Quality**: PASS. A primary goal of the refactor.
- **Documentation Requirements**: PASS. Plan includes documenting the new structured logging capabilities.
- **Versioning Requirements**: DEFERRED. Version will be updated during implementation.
- **Template File Requirements**: N/A.
- **Rule Validation**: PASS.

**Result**: All gates pass. No complexity justification is required.

### Source Code (repository root)

The implementation will refactor the existing logger module:

```
src/metaexpert/
└── logger/                  # MODIFIED: Entire module to be refactored.
    ├── __init__.py        # MODIFIED: To expose the logger and configure structlog.
    ├── async_handler.py   # RETAINED/MODIFIED: The core QueueHandler logic is kept.
    └── formatter.py       # REPLACED/MODIFIED: Replaced with structlog processors.

tests/
└── unit/
    └── test_logger.py     # NEW/MODIFIED: Add extensive tests to reach 95% coverage.
```

**Structure Decision**: The refactoring will occur in-place within the `src/metaexpert/logger/` directory. The public interface exposed in `logger/__init__.py` will be preserved. The internal files will be modified to use `structlog` for processing log records before they are passed to the `async_handler`.

## Complexity Tracking

No complexity tracking needed as no constitutional violations were identified.
