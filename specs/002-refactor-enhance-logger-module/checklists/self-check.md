# Checklist: Logger Refactor Developer Self-Check

**Purpose**: An informal self-check for the developer implementing the logger refactor. It focuses on ensuring backward compatibility and clear requirements for consumers of the logger.
**Created**: 2025-10-12

---

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] CHK001 - Are all public-facing functions and methods from the original logger module documented in the `logger-interface.md` contract? [Completeness, contracts/logger-interface.md]
- [X] CHK002 - Does the spec define how a consumer module should configure the logger (e.g., setting log level, choosing formatters)? [Gap]
- [X] CHK003 - Are requirements for log rotation (e.g., size or time-based) specified, or explicitly deferred? [Gap]

## Requirement Clarity

- [X] CHK004 - Is the requirement to preserve the exact signature and behavior of `get_logger()` explicitly stated? [Clarity, contracts/logger-interface.md]
- [X] CHK005 - Does the spec clarify if structured (JSON) logging is enabled by default or requires configuration by the consumer? [Clarity, Gap]
- [X] CHK006 - Is the requirement to support the legacy `extra={...}` parameter for contextual logging clearly defined? [Clarity, contracts/logger-interface.md]
- [X] CHK007 - Are the conditions and behavior for fallback logging to `stderr` (on I/O error) fully specified? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [X] CHK008 - Is the "5% performance overhead" requirement defined with a clear, repeatable benchmark scenario? [Measurability, Spec §SC-003]
- [X] CHK009 - Can the "95% test coverage" requirement be automatically verified by the CI pipeline? [Measurability, Spec §FR-004]

## Consumer-Facing Requirements

- [X] CHK010 - Is the new recommended method for adding context (e.g., `logger.bind()` or direct kwargs) clearly documented in a quickstart or guide for consumers? [Completeness, quickstart.md]
- [X] CHK011 - Are there clear requirements on how exceptions should be logged by consumer modules (e.g., using `log.exception()`)? [Gap]
