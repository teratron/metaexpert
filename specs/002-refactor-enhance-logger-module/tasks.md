# Tasks: Refactor and Enhance Logger Module

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-refactor-enhance-logger-module/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Tests**: The feature specification explicitly requires tests for enhanced maintainability (FR-004: 95% coverage), so test tasks are mandatory.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 [P] Add structlog as a project dependency in pyproject.toml
- [ ] T002 [P] Set up performance benchmarking tools for logger throughput testing
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure pytest and coverage tools to measure 95% target

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Configure structlog to work with existing QueueHandler mechanism in src/metaexpert/logger/
- [ ] T005 [P] Set up structured log format according to data-model.md schema in src/metaexpert/logger/formatter.py
- [ ] T006 [P] Create fallback error handling mechanism for I/O failures (e.g., disk full) in src/metaexpert/logger/async_handler.py
- [ ] T007 Create base test suite for logger module in tests/unit/test_logger.py
- [ ] T008 Set up performance benchmarking framework to measure <5% overhead requirement

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Developer Experience (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Enhance developer experience with a clean, performant API while preserving backward compatibility

**Independent Test**: Developers can configure and use the logger in under 5 minutes and verify performance doesn't exceed 5% overhead

### Tests for User Story 1 (Mandatory per FR-004) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T009 [P] [US1] Create performance benchmark tests for message throughput in tests/unit/test_logger.py
- [ ] T010 [US1] Create performance test to verify <5% overhead compared to no logging in tests/unit/test_logger.py
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Create API usability tests to verify simple configuration in <5 minutes in tests/unit/test_logger.py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement structlog processors to match data-model.md schema in src/metaexpert/logger/formatter.py
- [ ] T013 [US1] Integrate structlog with existing QueueHandler mechanism in src/metaexpert/logger/async_handler.py
- [ ] T014 [US1] Preserve backward compatibility by implementing legacy `extra` dict support in src/metaexpert/logger/__init__.py
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement structured log formatting with JSON output in src/metaexpert/logger/formatter.py
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add performance monitoring to logger operations in src/metaexpert/logger/__init__.py
- [ ] T017 [US1] Update logger public interface to support both legacy and structured logging in src/metaexpert/logger/__init__.py

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Maintainer Confidence (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Improve internal code quality, testing coverage, and maintainability

**Independent Test**: Code quality metrics and test coverage can be measured with >95% coverage

### Tests for User Story 2 (Mandatory per FR-004) ‚ö†Ô∏è

- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Create unit tests for all logging components to reach 95% coverage in tests/unit/test_logger.py
- [ ] T019 [US2] Add static analysis tests to verify code quality standards in tests/unit/test_logger.py
- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create integration tests for logger with other system components in tests/unit/test_logger.py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T021 [P] [US2] Refactor logger module files for better readability and structure in src/metaexpert/logger/
- [ ] T022 [P] [US2] Add comprehensive docstrings and type hints to all public methods in src/metaexpert/logger/__init__.py
- [ ] T023 [US2] Implement structured logging with context binding (bind method) in src/metaexpert/logger/__init__.py
- [ ] T024 [US2] Enhance unit tests to reach 95% coverage requirement in tests/unit/test_logger.py
- [ ] T025 [US2] Implement cyclomatic complexity reduction measures in src/metaexpert/logger/
- [ ] T026 [US2] Update all static analysis configurations to pass with zero errors in src/metaexpert/logger/

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T027 [P] Update documentation in docs/guides/logging.md with new structured logging capabilities
- [ ] T028 Code cleanup and refactoring to reduce complexity
- [ ] T029 [P] Run comprehensive test suite to ensure 95%+ coverage for logger module
- [ ] T030 Performance optimization to ensure <5% performance deviation from original
- [ ] T031 Security validation: Ensure no sensitive data is leaked in logs
- [ ] T032 Update README with new structured logging examples
- [ ] T033 Performance validation: Run benchmarks to verify <5% performance deviation from original implementation
- [ ] T034 Code quality validation: Measure and verify cyclomatic complexity reduced by at least 20%
- [ ] T035 Coverage validation: Run coverage tool and confirm >95% for logger module
- [ ] T036 Code quality validation: Run ruff and pyright with zero errors/warnings on logger module
- [ ] T037 Fallback handling validation: Test that logs go to stderr when primary target fails
- [ ] T038 High-frequency logging validation: Test logger behavior under thousands of messages per second
- [ ] T039 Backward compatibility validation: Verify existing API continues to work as documented in contracts/logger-interface.md

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2)
- **Polish (Phase 5)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No direct dependencies on US1

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create performance benchmark tests for message throughput in tests/unit/test_logger.py"
Task: "Create API usability tests to verify simple configuration in <5 minutes in tests/unit/test_logger.py"

# Launch all implementation tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement structlog processors to match data-model.md schema in src/metaexpert/logger/formatter.py"
Task: "Preserve backward compatibility by implementing legacy `extra` dict support in src/metaexpert/logger/__init__.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Verify performance and usability requirements are met before proceeding

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Verify performance and usability
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Verify coverage and quality requirements
4. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (developer experience)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (maintainer confidence)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
