# Research: CLI Framework Selection

**Task**: Research and select the best Python CLI framework for the MetaExpert project.

## Decision

We will use **Typer** as the primary framework for building the MetaExpert CLI.

## Rationale

- **Modern & Type-Hint Based**: Typer is built around modern Python type hints. This aligns perfectly with the project's constitution, which mandates Python 3.12+ and validation with `pyright`. It allows for clean, declarative, and self-documenting code.
- **Low Boilerplate**: It significantly reduces the amount of boilerplate code required compared to the standard `argparse` library.
- **Automatic Help Generation**: Typer automatically generates user-friendly help messages from the function signatures and docstrings, directly fulfilling the requirements of User Story 2 with minimal effort.
- **Based on Click**: It is built on top of `Click`, a mature and robust CLI framework, inheriting its stability and power while providing a more modern interface.
- **Developer Experience**: The API is simple, intuitive, and enjoyable to use, which speeds up development and reduces the learning curve.

## Alternatives Considered

- **`argparse`**: This is the standard library solution. It was rejected because it is verbose, requires significant boilerplate, and its imperative style is less readable than Typer's declarative approach.
- **`click`**: A very strong contender and the foundation for Typer. While excellent, Typer was chosen as the superior option because its direct integration with type hints is a more natural fit for this specific project's established coding standards.
