2. **manual-testing.md** - Manual testing procedures for validation

### API Contracts
1. **contracts/logging-configure.md** - Contract for logging configuration endpoint

### Task Planning
1. **tasks.md** - Actionable, dependency-ordered tasks for implementation

## Key Enhancements

### Structured Logging
Implementation of JSON-formatted structured logging for better searchability and analysis of log data.

### Asynchronous Logging
Non-blocking logging operations to minimize performance impact in high-frequency trading scenarios.

### Centralized Configuration
Unified logging configuration management for easier maintenance and consistency.

### Backward Compatibility
Maintaining compatibility with existing code that uses the current logging system.

### Performance Optimization
Efficient logging implementation with minimal overhead.

## Constitutional Compliance
The implementation fully complies with the MetaExpert Constitution v1.1.0:
- **Library-First Development**: All features implemented as self-contained, independently testable libraries
- **CLI Interface Standard**: Functionality exposed via Command Line Interface with text-based protocols
- **Test-First Development**: Implementation follows Test-Driven Development principles
- **Integration Testing Coverage**: Contracts and integration points properly tested
- **Observability & Versioning**: Structured logging implemented, versioning follows MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format
- **Package Management**: Only UV package manager used for dependency management

## Task Generation Summary
