## Conclusion

The MetaExpert Logging System Enhancement has been successfully implemented following all constitutional principles:

1. **Library-First Development**: All features start as standalone libraries that are self-contained, independently testable, and well-documented.
2. **CLI Interface Standard**: Functionality is exposed via Command Line Interface with text-based protocols.
3. **Test-First Development**: Test-Driven Development is mandatory with Red-Green-Refactor cycle enforcement.
4. **Integration Testing Coverage**: Integration tests are required for new contracts, contract changes, and inter-service communication.
5. **Observability & Versioning**: Structured logging is required, and versioning follows MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format.
6. **Package Management**: Only the UV package manager must be used for all dependency management tasks.

The implementation provides developers with a robust, flexible, and high-performance logging system while maintaining backward compatibility with existing MetaExpert functionality.
