# Feature Specification: MetaExpert Logging System Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `002-logging-enhancement`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Review the existing logging system across the entire MetaExpert project, fix issues, improve functionality (e.g., add structured logging and levels), optimize performance (e.g., reduce overhead, integrate async logging), and perform refactoring (e.g., centralize loggers, remove duplicates). Ensure changes align with the template.py reference without modifying it."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user strategies"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the MetaExpert library, I want a robust and efficient logging system so that I can effectively monitor and debug my trading strategies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a trading strategy is running, **When** an event occurs, **Then** the event is logged with appropriate structured data and severity level.
2. **Given** a high-frequency trading scenario, **When** many events occur rapidly, **Then** the logging system performs efficiently without causing significant overhead.
3. **Given** a developer is debugging a strategy, **When** they review logs, **Then** they can easily find relevant information due to structured logging format.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the logging system encounters an error while logging?
- How does the system handle high-volume logging scenarios?
- How does the system behave when disk space is low?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide structured logging with consistent format across all components.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement asynchronous logging to reduce performance overhead.
- **FR-004**: System MUST centralize logger configuration to avoid duplicates and inconsistencies.
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain compatibility with existing template.py without requiring modifications.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide configurable output destinations (console, file, network).
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle logging errors gracefully without crashing the application.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Log Entry**: A structured log record containing timestamp, level, message, and additional context.
- **Logger**: A component responsible for creating and managing log entries.
- **Log Handler**: A component responsible for outputting log entries to specific destinations.
- **Log Configuration**: Settings that control logging behavior, levels, and outputs.
