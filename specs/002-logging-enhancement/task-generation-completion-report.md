## Task Generation Summary
The tasks.md file contains 23 specifically numbered and dependency-ordered tasks covering all aspects of the logging enhancement implementation:

### Phase 3.1: Setup (3 tasks)
- T001: Create project structure per implementation plan
- T002: Initialize Python project with dependencies
- T003: Configure linting and formatting tools

### Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) (4 tasks)
- T004 [P]: Contract test POST /logging/configure
- T005 [P]: Integration test structured logging
- T006 [P]: Integration test async logging performance
- T007 [P]: Integration test logger centralization

### Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (6 tasks)
- T008 [P]: Logger service in src/metaexpert/logger/__init__.py
- T009 [P]: Async logging handler
- T010 [P]: Structured log formatter
- T011: Centralized logging configuration
- T012: Logger factory
- T013: Error handling for logging operations
- T014: Performance optimization for high-frequency logging

### Phase 3.4: Integration (4 tasks)
- T015: Connect enhanced logger to MetaExpert core
- T016: Integrate with existing template.py configuration
- T017: Maintain backward compatibility with existing logger module
- T018: Performance monitoring and metrics

### Phase 3.5: Polish (6 tasks)
- T019 [P]: Unit tests for log formatter
- T020: Performance tests
- T021 [P]: Update docs/logging.md
- T022: Remove duplication with existing logging code
- T023: Run manual-testing.md

## Key Features Covered
1. **Structured Logging**: Implementation of JSON-formatted structured logging
2. **Asynchronous Logging**: Non-blocking logging operations for performance
3. **Centralized Configuration**: Unified logging configuration management
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility with existing code
5. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient logging with minimal overhead

## Constitutional Compliance
The generated tasks fully comply with the MetaExpert Constitution v1.1.0:
- ✅ Library-First Development principle
- ✅ Test-First Development (TDD) approach
- ✅ Integration Testing Coverage
- ✅ Observability & Versioning requirements

## Implementation Readiness
The tasks.md file is immediately executable with each task specific enough for an LLM to complete without additional context. All tasks follow the required dependency ordering:
- Setup tasks before everything else
- Tests before implementation (TDD)
- Core implementation before integration
- Everything before polish tasks

The logging enhancement feature is ready for implementation phase.
