# Tasks: MetaExpert Logging System Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-logging-enhancement/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [x] T002 Initialize Python project with dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
In accordance with the Test-First Development principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE) from the MetaExpert Constitution:
- [x] T004 [P] Contract test POST /logging/configure in tests/contract/test_logging_configuration.py
- [x] T005 [P] Integration test structured logging in tests/integration/test_structured_logging.py
- [x] T006 [P] Integration test async logging performance in tests/integration/test_async_logging.py
- [x] T007 [P] Integration test logger centralization in tests/integration/test_logger_centralization.py

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [x] T008 [P] Logger service in src/metaexpert/logger/__init__.py
- [x] T009 [P] Async logging handler in src/metaexpert/logger/async_log_handler.py
- [x] T010 [P] Structured log formatter in src/metaexpert/logger/structured_log_formatter.py
- [x] T011 Centralized logging configuration in src/metaexpert/logger/config.py
- [x] T012 Logger factory in src/metaexpert/logger/logger_factory.py
- [x] T013 Error handling for logging operations
- [x] T014 Performance optimization for high-frequency logging

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [x] T015 Connect enhanced logger to MetaExpert core
- [x] T016 Integrate with existing template.py configuration
- [x] T017 Maintain backward compatibility with existing logger module
- [x] T018 Performance monitoring and metrics

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [x] T019 [P] Unit tests for template validation in tests/unit/test_template_validation.py
- [x] T020 [P] Unit tests for configuration validation in tests/unit/test_config_validation.py
- [x] T021 Performance tests (<200ms)
- [x] T022 [P] Update docs/template.md
- [x] T023 [P] Update docs/configuration.md
- [x] T024 Remove duplication
- [x] T025 Run manual-testing.md

## Dependencies
- Tests (T004-T007) before implementation (T008-T014)
- T008-T014 blocks T015-T018
- T015-T018 blocks T019-T025
- Implementation before polish (T019-T025)

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

In accordance with the MetaExpert Constitution v1.1.0:
- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (Integration Testing Coverage principle)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (Library-First Development principle)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Test-First Development principle)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (Library-First Development principle)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
