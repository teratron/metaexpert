# Feature Specification: Unified Trading Interface for MetaExpert Library

**Feature Branch**: `feature/unified-trading-interface-spec`  \n
**Created**: 2025-10-13  \n
**Status**: Draft  \n
**Input**: User description: "001-unified-trading-interface: Create a complete project specification based on the current structure and architecture located in the @/src/metaexpert directory. Pay special attention to the file @/src/metaexpert/template/template.py , which should be used to create a template for the end developer using this library. The specification should contain a description of the architecture, interfaces, data structure, initialization processes, as well as instructions for integrating and using the template in third-party projects."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Template-Based Strategy Creation (Priority: P1)

As a cryptocurrency trading developer, I want to use the MetaExpert template to quickly create my own trading strategy, so that I can focus on strategy logic rather than infrastructure setup.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables developers to leverage the library effectively. Without an easily usable template, the value of the entire library is diminished.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new strategy using the template, implementing basic logic, and successfully running it in paper trading mode.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer has installed MetaExpert library, **When** they use the template to create a new strategy, **Then** they get a working skeleton with all necessary components pre-configured
2. **Given** developer has the template, **When** they fill in their strategy parameters and logic, **Then** they can run the strategy successfully with minimal additional code changes

### User Story 2 - Multi-Exchange Unified Interface (Priority: P2)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to deploy the same trading strategy across multiple exchanges using a unified interface, so that I can capitalize on opportunities across different platforms without rewriting code.

**Why this priority**: This provides the core value proposition of the library by offering a unified interface across exchanges.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by implementing a strategy that works on one exchange and verifying minimal code changes are needed to run it on another exchange.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a working strategy on one exchange, **When** trader configures it for another supported exchange, **Then** the same strategy logic executes with minimal parameter adjustments
2. **Given** trader has accounts on multiple exchanges, **When** they run the same strategy across exchanges, **Then** each exchange executes the strategy independently while maintaining unified configuration

---

### User Story 3 - Strategy Configuration and Management (Priority: P3)

As a trading strategy developer, I want to configure all strategy parameters through a unified configuration system, so that I can easily manage risk and adjust behavior without changing code.

**Why this priority**: Configuration flexibility is essential for strategy development and risk management.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by changing configuration parameters and verifying that strategy behavior changes accordingly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer has a strategy with configurable parameters, **When** they modify the configuration, **Then** the strategy behavior adapts according to the new parameters
2. **Given** risk management parameters are defined, **When** market conditions trigger risk events, **Then** the system automatically executes risk mitigation according to configuration

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an exchange API is temporarily unavailable during live trading?
- How does the system handle rate limits exceeded during intensive operations?
- What occurs when market conditions change rapidly during order execution across different exchanges?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a template file that serves as a starting point for creating new trading strategies with all necessary configuration sections pre-defined
- **FR-002**: Template MUST include configuration sections for exchange connection parameters (API keys, testnet, proxy settings)

- **FR-004**: Template MUST provide event handler functions with appropriate decorators (on_init, on_bar, on_tick, on_order, etc.)
- **FR-005**: System MUST support multiple exchange connections through a unified interface (Binance, Bybit, OKX, Bitget, KuCoin)
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to specify trade mode (paper, live, backtest) with appropriate parameters
- **FR-007**: System MUST support multiple trading types (spot, futures, options) and contract types (linear, inverse)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide comprehensive logging capabilities with configurable log levels and output destinations
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement risk management features including stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing controls
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle authentication for different exchanges with appropriate credential requirements (api_key, api_secret, api_passphrase)
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide backtesting capabilities with configurable date ranges and initial capital
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement rate limiting controls to prevent API abuse
- **FR-013**: System MUST persist state between runs when enabled in configuration
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide comprehensive error handling for network, API, and runtime errors
- **FR-015**: System MUST support multi-timeframe strategies with appropriate event handlers
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide portfolio management features including position tracking and account balance monitoring
- **FR-017**: System MUST support 1 strategy per instance to ensure clear resource allocation and easier debugging 
- **FR-018**: System MUST process most market data with <200ms latency, with exceptions for complex operations
- **FR-019**: System MUST store API credentials in environment variables only for security
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide a unified data model for market data, trades, positions, and orders across all exchanges
- **FR-021**: System MUST normalize exchange-specific APIs and data formats to a common interface
- **FR-022**: System MUST support real-time market data streaming from multiple exchanges simultaneously
- **FR-023**: System MUST support up to 3 exchanges connected simultaneously

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
