# Feature Specification: Exception Handling Module

## Overview
Add a dedicated exceptions module to the project to handle custom errors specific to the library. The module should be logically structured and integrate with existing components.

## Requirements
1. Create a dedicated exceptions module for the library
2. The module should handle custom errors specific to the library
3. The module should be logically structured
4. The module should integrate with existing components
5. Follow the Library-First Development principle from the constitution
6. Ensure all exceptions are properly documented
7. Provide clear error messages for developers using the library

## User Stories
1. As a developer, I want to use specific exception types so that I can handle different error conditions appropriately
2. As a library user, I want clear error messages so that I can quickly understand what went wrong
3. As a maintainer, I want a centralized place for all custom exceptions so that I can easily manage them

## Technical Requirements
1. The exceptions module should be in the src/metaexpert directory
2. The module should follow Python best practices for exception handling
3. The module should integrate with existing components without breaking changes
4. All exceptions should inherit from a base exception class
5. The module should be well-documented with docstrings
6. The module should include unit tests

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new exceptions module exists in the project
2. The module contains logically organized custom exception classes
3. The module integrates with existing components
4. Unit tests pass for all new exception classes
5. Existing functionality is not broken by the new module
6. Documentation is updated to reflect the new module
