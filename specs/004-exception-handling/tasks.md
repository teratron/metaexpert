# Tasks: Exception Handling Module

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-exception-handling/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize Python project with dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
In accordance with the Test-First Development principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE) from the MetaExpert Constitution:
- [x] T004 [P] Contract test base exceptions in tests/contract/test_base_exceptions.py
- [x] T005 [P] Contract test configuration exceptions in tests/contract/test_configuration_exceptions.py
- [x] T006 [P] Contract test API exceptions in tests/contract/test_api_exceptions.py
- [x] T007 [P] Contract test trading exceptions in tests/contract/test_trading_exceptions.py
- [x] T008 [P] Contract test validation exceptions in tests/contract/test_validation_exceptions.py
- [x] T009 [P] Contract test market data exceptions in tests/contract/test_market_data_exceptions.py
- [x] T010 [P] Contract test process exceptions in tests/contract/test_process_exceptions.py
- [x] T011 [P] Integration test exception hierarchy in tests/integration/test_exception_hierarchy.py
- [x] T012 [P] Integration test exception handling in existing components in tests/integration/test_exception_integration.py

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [x] T013 Create exceptions module in src/metaexpert/exceptions.py
- [x] T014 Implement MetaExpertError base class
- [x] T015 Implement ConfigurationError classes (ConfigurationError, InvalidConfigurationError, MissingConfigurationError)
- [x] T016 Implement APIError classes (APIError, AuthenticationError, RateLimitError, NetworkError)
- [x] T017 Implement TradingError classes (TradingError, InsufficientFundsError, InvalidOrderError, OrderNotFoundError)
- [x] T018 Implement ValidationError classes (ValidationError, InvalidDataError, MissingDataError)
- [x] T019 Implement MarketDataError classes (MarketDataError, UnsupportedPairError, InvalidTimeframeError)
- [x] T020 Implement ProcessError classes (ProcessError, InitializationError, ShutdownError)
- [x] T021 Add proper docstrings and type hints
- [x] T022 Ensure backward compatibility with existing error handling

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T023 Integrate exceptions module with MetaExpert core components
- [ ] T024 Update existing code to use new exception classes where appropriate
- [ ] T025 Verify exception handling in exchange modules
- [ ] T026 Verify exception handling in trading modules
- [ ] T027 Verify exception handling in configuration modules

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [x] T028 [P] Unit tests for exception classes in tests/unit/test_exceptions.py
- [x] T029 Performance tests (minimal overhead)
- [x] T030 [P] Update docs/exceptions.md
- [x] T031 Remove duplication
- [x] T032 Run manual-testing.md

## Dependencies
- Tests (T004-T012) before implementation (T013-T022)
- T013 blocks T014-T021
- T023-T027 blocks T031
- Implementation before polish (T028-T032)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T004-T010 together:
Task: "Contract test base exceptions in tests/contract/test_base_exceptions.py"
Task: "Contract test configuration exceptions in tests/contract/test_configuration_exceptions.py"
Task: "Contract test API exceptions in tests/contract/test_api_exceptions.py"
Task: "Contract test trading exceptions in tests/contract/test_trading_exceptions.py"
Task: "Contract test validation exceptions in tests/contract/test_validation_exceptions.py"
Task: "Contract test market data exceptions in tests/contract/test_market_data_exceptions.py"
Task: "Contract test process exceptions in tests/contract/test_process_exceptions.py"

# Launch T014-T021 together:
Task: "Implement MetaExpertError base class"
Task: "Implement ConfigurationError classes"
Task: "Implement APIError classes"
Task: "Implement TradingError classes"
Task: "Implement ValidationError classes"
Task: "Implement MarketDataError classes"
Task: "Implement ProcessError classes"
Task: "Add proper docstrings and type hints"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

In accordance with the MetaExpert Constitution v2.1.1:
- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (Integration Testing Coverage principle)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (Library-First Development principle)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Test-First Development principle)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (Library-First Development principle)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
