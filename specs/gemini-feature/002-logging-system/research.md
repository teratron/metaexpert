# Research: Asynchronous Webhook Notifications

**Date**: 2025-10-17

## Subject

Investigate and select a suitable Python library for sending asynchronous HTTP requests to deliver real-time webhook notifications for the logging system.

## Decision

**Use `httpx` for all asynchronous HTTP requests.**

## Rationale

The feature specification requires that the logging system, particularly the real-time alerting component, be non-blocking to avoid impacting the performance of the main trading application. This necessitates the use of an asynchronous HTTP client.

- **Async-First**: `httpx` is a modern library designed with first-class `async`/`await` support. It is the natural choice for integration with an `asyncio`-based application like MetaExpert.
- **Industry Standard**: It is widely regarded as the successor to the `requests` library for modern Python development and has a compatible API, which simplifies adoption.
- **Performance**: It provides high performance suitable for sending time-sensitive critical alerts without delaying the core trading logic.
- **Robustness**: It includes essential features like timeouts, connection pooling, and proxy support out-of-the-box.

## Alternatives Considered

- **`aiohttp`**: A powerful and mature library for async HTTP. However, its client API is generally considered more complex and less intuitive than `httpx`. For the simple use case of sending POST requests to a webhook, the added complexity is not justified.
- **`requests`**: The classic Python HTTP library. It is synchronous-only and therefore unsuitable for this feature, as it would block the event loop and introduce significant latency, violating a key non-functional requirement.
