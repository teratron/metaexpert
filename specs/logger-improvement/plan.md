# Implementation Plan: Logger Module Improvement

**Branch**: `logger-improvement` | **Date**: 2025-10-09 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/logger-improvement/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Enhance the MetaExpert logging system to provide structured JSON logging, asynchronous processing, and multiple output destinations for efficient system monitoring and troubleshooting in high-frequency trading environments. The implementation will focus on specialized trade event logging, comprehensive error tracking, performance monitoring metrics, and configurable log retention policies while maintaining compliance with security and regulatory requirements.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12  \n**Primary Dependencies**: logging, queue, threading, json, pathlib  \n**Storage**: File system (local and network destinations)  \n**Testing**: pytest  \n**Target Platform**: Linux server, Windows, macOS\n**Project Type**: Single project - cryptocurrency trading library  \n**Performance Goals**: Sub-1ms log entry creation time for 99% of operations, 10,000 log entries per second sustained throughput  \n**Constraints**: <200ms p95 latency for critical error logging, <100MB memory overhead for logging operations  \n**Scale/Scope**: Support 10k+ concurrent log operations, multi-gigabyte log files with efficient rotation

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Code and documentation language requirements: All code, comments, documentation, variable names, function names, class names, method names, and attribute names MUST be in English to ensure readability and maintainability
- Communication style: Explanations and discussions in the chat interface should be in Russian for conversational responses and clarifications
- Language compliance: Technical documentation, inline comments, and docstrings MUST be written in English
- Template management: Ensure any AI agent actions and outputs do not conflict with the structure, parameters, or functionality defined in template.py as required by the constitution
- Cryptocurrency trading focus: Confirm that the implementation aligns with MetaExpert's purpose as a cryptocurrency trading library providing unified interfaces for multiple exchanges
- Multi-exchange support: Verify implementation supports major exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, etc.) as specified in the constitution
- Trading types coverage: Ensure support for all major trading types (spot, futures, margin, options) as required
- Event-driven architecture: Confirm implementation follows the required event-driven approach for trading strategies
- Decorator-based strategy implementation: Verify strategies can be implemented using decorators as specified
- Trading modes support: Check that both paper trading and live trading modes are supported
- Risk management: Confirm comprehensive risk management features are implemented as required
- Documentation management: Ensure documentation in the @/docs directory is updated with every functional change, preserving the existing structure (api, guides, tutorials) and keeping README.md current with functionality descriptions, usage examples, and configuration information
- Version management: Confirm that significant functional changes update the project version according to SemVer conventions in all relevant files (@/pyproject.toml, @/README.md, @/src/metaexpert/__version__.py, @/docs/*, etc.) while considering dependencies, documentation updates, API changes, and backward compatibility
- Project structure compliance: Ensure the implementation follows the required project structure with @/src/metaexpert containing the core library with a modular system where each module handles specific functions (avoid creating model and service modules) and @/examples containing three sample projects that serve as verification material for client developers
- Object-Oriented Programming: Ensure code follows OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction as required by the constitution
- SOLID Design Principles: Verify implementation follows Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion Principles
- DRY Principle: Confirm code elimination of duplication and single source of truth as required by the constitution
- KISS Principle: Verify code maintains simplicity and avoids unnecessary complexity as required by the constitution
- YAGNI Principle: Ensure only currently needed functionality is implemented, not anticipated future needs as required by the constitution
- Feature-Sliced Design: Confirm architectural methodology uses layer-based organization where each feature is implemented as a cohesive slice spanning all necessary layers

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure with enhanced logger module that extends the existing logging functionality while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
