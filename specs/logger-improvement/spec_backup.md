# Feature Specification: Logger Module Improvement

**Feature Branch**: `logger-improvement`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Explore and analyze the @/src/metaexpert/logger module developed earlier. The concept of the module remains relevant, but it needs to be brought into line with current requirements and improved to a functional state, eliminating possible errors and shortcomings in accordance with the updated implementation plan."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Enhanced Logging Configuration (Priority: P1)

As a cryptocurrency trading system administrator, I want to configure advanced logging options including structured JSON logging, asynchronous processing, and multiple output destinations so that I can efficiently monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues without impacting trading performance.

**Why this priority**: Proper logging configuration is fundamental to system observability and performance. Without efficient logging, diagnosing issues in a high-frequency trading environment becomes extremely difficult.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring different logging options and verifying that logs are generated in the expected format and destination with appropriate performance characteristics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a system with logging enabled, **When** structured JSON logging is configured, **Then** all log entries are formatted as valid JSON with consistent fields
2. **Given** a high-throughput trading system, **When** asynchronous logging is enabled, **Then** logging operations do not block trading activities and system performance remains unaffected
3. **Given** a production environment, **When** multiple log destinations are configured (file, console, network), **Then** log entries appear in all configured destinations without duplication or loss

### User Story 2 - Specialized Trade Event Logging (Priority: P2)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want specialized logging for trade events including order placement, execution, cancellation, and position changes so that I can analyze trading performance and identify issues in my strategies.

**Why this priority**: Trade-specific logging is essential for strategy analysis and compliance reporting. Without detailed trade event logging, traders cannot effectively evaluate their performance or meet regulatory requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by executing sample trades and verifying that all trade events are logged with complete and accurate information including timestamps, symbols, quantities, prices, and order identifiers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trading strategy executing buy orders, **When** an order is placed, **Then** a detailed log entry is created with order parameters, timestamp, and unique identifier
2. **Given** an executed trade, **When** the trade completes, **Then** a log entry captures execution price, quantity, fees, and timestamps
3. **Given** a cancelled order, **When** cancellation occurs, **Then** a log entry records the reason, timestamp, and remaining quantity

### User Story 3 - Error and Exception Tracking (Priority: P3)

As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error and exception logging with detailed stack traces and contextual information so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve system issues.

**Why this priority**: Effective error tracking is critical for system reliability and quick issue resolution. In trading systems, where milliseconds matter, rapid diagnosis of errors can prevent significant financial losses.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by intentionally triggering various error conditions and verifying that detailed error logs are generated with appropriate context and stack traces.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a network connectivity issue, **When** an API call fails, **Then** a detailed error log is created with connection details, error code, and stack trace
2. **Given** an invalid order parameter, **When** order validation fails, **Then** a log entry includes the invalid parameter, validation rule, and relevant context
3. **Given** an unexpected exception in trading logic, **When** the exception occurs, **Then** a comprehensive log entry captures the full stack trace, local variables, and execution context

---

### User Story 4 - Performance Monitoring and Metrics (Priority: P4)

As a DevOps engineer, I want performance metrics and monitoring data logged continuously so that I can track system health and optimize resource allocation.

**Why this priority**: Performance monitoring is essential for maintaining optimal system operation and planning capacity upgrades. Without metrics logging, system bottlenecks remain undetected until they cause failures.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running system performance tests and verifying that metrics are logged at regular intervals with accurate measurements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running trading system, **When** performance monitoring is enabled, **Then** periodic log entries capture CPU usage, memory consumption, and network I/O statistics
2. **Given** a high-volume trading session, **When** latency metrics are collected, **Then** log entries record API response times, order processing delays, and market data update intervals
3. **Given** system resource constraints, **When** threshold limits are exceeded, **Then** warning log entries are generated with current values and configured limits

---

### User Story 5 - Log Retention and Archival Management (Priority: P5)

As a compliance officer, I want configurable log retention policies and archival mechanisms so that I can meet regulatory requirements for data preservation while managing storage costs.

**Why this priority**: Log retention is often mandated by financial regulations, and proper archival ensures compliance while optimizing storage usage. Without configurable retention, organizations risk non-compliance penalties or excessive storage costs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring retention policies and verifying that old log files are properly rotated, compressed, and archived according to settings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a configured retention policy of 90 days, **When** log files exceed this age, **Then** they are automatically compressed and moved to archival storage
2. **Given** storage space constraints, **When** disk usage approaches limits, **Then** the oldest log files are purged according to retention settings
3. **Given** a compliance audit request, **When** archived logs are requested, **Then** they can be easily retrieved and restored for review

### Edge Cases

- What happens when disk space is exhausted during high-volume logging?
- How does the system handle network failures when sending logs to remote destinations?
- What occurs when log file permissions are insufficient for writing?
- How does asynchronous logging handle queue overflow during system overload?
- What happens when timestamp synchronization fails across distributed components?
