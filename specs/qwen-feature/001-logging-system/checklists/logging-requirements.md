# Logging System Requirements Quality Checklist

**Purpose**: Unit tests for logging system requirements - validating completeness, clarity, and coverage
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: 001-logging-system

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are all log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) explicitly defined with their intended usage? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]

- [ ] CHK003 - Is the RFC 5424 structured JSON format requirement completely defined with schema details? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK004 - Are all contextual fields (expert_name, symbol, trade_id, order_id, strategy_id, account_id) specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are performance requirements completely defined for both throughput (10,000 entries/sec) and latency (10ms)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK006 - Are all configuration methods (code, environment variables, CLI) with priority order completely specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK007 - Are log rotation parameters (max file size, backup count) completely defined with default values? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK008 - Are API access requirements to logging capabilities via MetaExpert.logger property fully specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK009 - Is the 10ms latency requirement quantified with specific measurement criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK010 - Is the "10,000 entries per second" performance requirement defined with specific test conditions? [Clarity, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK011 - Are the configuration priority rules (CLI > env vars > code) clearly defined with examples? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK012 - Is the RFC 5424 JSON format requirement specific enough to ensure consistent implementation? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK013 - Are the "comprehensive context fields" requirement specific about which fields are included? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK014 - Is the "console-only logging mode" fallback requirement clearly defined with trigger conditions? [Clarity, Spec Edge Cases]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK015 - Do performance requirements align between functional requirement (FR-011) and success criteria (SC-002)? [Consistency]
- [ ] CHK016 - Are log file requirements consistent between functional requirements (FR-004) and user stories? [Consistency]
- [ ] CHK017 - Do configuration methods requirements align across all specification sections? [Consistency]
- [ ] CHK018 - Are the structured logging requirements consistent between functional and success criteria? [Consistency]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK019 - Are success criteria (SC-001 to SC-009) measurable and objectively verifiable? [Measurability]
- [ ] CHK020 - Is the 99.5% contextual information requirement in SC-004 objectively measurable? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK021 - Can the "no data loss" requirement in SC-003 be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK022 - Are API compliance requirements in SC-008 measurable against specific schema standards? [Measurability, Spec §SC-008]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK023 - Are requirements defined for high-volume logging scenarios that exceed buffer capacity? [Coverage, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK024 - Are requirements specified for file locking scenarios where logs cannot be written? [Coverage, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK025 - Are system failure scenarios addressed when logging system itself fails? [Coverage, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK026 - Are requirements defined for disk space exhaustion scenarios? [Coverage, Spec Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK027 - Are asynchronous logging failure scenarios covered with appropriate fallbacks? [Coverage, Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK028 - Are requirements specified for when sensitive data (API keys, account details) appears in logs? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK029 - Are requirements defined for log file corruption scenarios? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK030 - Are requirements covered for concurrent access to log files from multiple experts? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK031 - Are requirements addressed for network logging scenarios (if applicable)? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK032 - Are security requirements defined for masking sensitive information in logs? [Security, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK033 - Are performance requirements defined for all critical logging operations? [Performance, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK034 - Are reliability requirements defined for logging system resilience? [Reliability, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK035 - Are scalability requirements defined for concurrent logging from multiple experts? [Scalability, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK036 - Are dependencies on structlog library explicitly documented in requirements? [Dependency]
- [ ] CHK037 - Are assumptions about file system access and permissions validated in requirements? [Assumption, Gap]
- [ ] CHK038 - Are external monitoring system integration assumptions documented? [Assumption, Gap]
- [ ] CHK039 - Are system resource (memory, CPU) assumptions for async logging documented? [Assumption, Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK040 - Is there any ambiguity in the log rotation requirements between different specification sections? [Ambiguity]
- [ ] CHK041 - Are there conflicts between performance requirements and structured logging requirements? [Conflict]
- [ ] CHK042 - Is there clarity on what constitutes "trading events" that should go to trades.log? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK043 - Is the definition of "logging system failure" unambiguously specified? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-009]
