## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Initialize Logging System (Priority: P1)

As a developer creating a trading expert, I want to initialize a comprehensive logging system that automatically configures itself based on my MetaExpert configuration so that I can track my expert's behavior, debug issues, and monitor trading activities effectively.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational functionality that must exist before any other logging features can work. Without a properly initialized logging system, users cannot understand what their trading expert is doing or troubleshoot issues.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a MetaExpert instance with logging parameters and verifying that the logger object is properly configured with the correct log levels, handlers, and format settings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a MetaExpert instance with default logging parameters, **When** the instance is created, **Then** a logger is configured with default settings (INFO level, console and file logging, etc.)
2. **Given** a MetaExpert instance with custom logging parameters, **When** the instance is created, **Then** the logger is configured with the specified parameters (custom log level, file paths, etc.)

### User Story 2 - Log Different Event Types to Appropriate Files (Priority: P1)

As a trader, I want to have different types of events logged to different files (general events, trade events, and errors) so that I can efficiently analyze performance, audit trading operations, and troubleshoot issues without sifting through unrelated information.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for effective monitoring and troubleshooting. Having all log messages in one file would make it impossible to analyze trading operations efficiently or identify problems quickly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering different types of log events (general, trade-related, and error) and verifying they appear in the correct log files (expert.log, trades.log, errors.log).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running trading expert, **When** general events occur (init, shutdown, status updates), **Then** these events are logged to expert.log file
2. **Given** a running trading expert, **When** trading events occur (order creation, execution, position changes), **Then** these events are logged to trades.log file
3. **Given** a running trading expert, **When** errors occur, **Then** these events are logged to errors.log file

### User Story 3 - Contextual and Structured Logging (Priority: P2)

As a system administrator, I want to have structured, contextual log messages that include relevant domain information (expert name, symbol, trade ID) so that I can efficiently parse logs programmatically and quickly identify relevant information when issues occur.

**Why this priority**: This enables efficient log analysis and integration with external monitoring systems. Without contextual information, troubleshooting becomes significantly more difficult.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by examining log output and verifying that contextual information is consistently included in log entries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a trading expert with contextual information, **When** log messages are generated, **Then** they include relevant context (expert name, symbol, etc.)
2. **Given** structured logging is enabled, **When** log messages are generated, **Then** they are formatted as JSON objects with complete information

---

### User Story 4 - Configure Logging via Multiple Methods (Priority: P2)

As a developer or system administrator, I want to configure logging via multiple methods (code, environment variables, CLI arguments) with a clear priority order so that I can easily adjust logging behavior in different environments and deployment scenarios.

**Why this priority**: This flexibility is essential for different deployment scenarios (local development, testing, production) and allows administrators to adjust logging behavior without changing code.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting the same configuration parameter through different methods and verifying the priority order is respected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** logging parameters set via CLI arguments, environment variables, and code, **When** the expert is initialized, **Then** CLI arguments take precedence over other methods
2. **Given** logging parameters set via environment variables and code, **When** the expert is initialized, **Then** code parameters take precedence over environment variables

---

### User Story 5 - High-Performance Asynchronous Logging (Priority: P3)

As a trader running live trading systems, I want the logging system to operate asynchronously so that logging operations don't block trading execution and impact performance.

**Why this priority**: In live trading scenarios, any delay can result in missed opportunities or losses. Performance is critical in live environments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by measuring the performance difference between synchronous and asynchronous logging during high-frequency trading operations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** async logging is enabled, **When** multiple log entries are generated rapidly, **Then** the main trading thread is not blocked by logging operations

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the disk is full and the logging system cannot write to files? → System should detect low disk space (when < 100MB free) and automatically switch to console-only logging mode with a warning message. When disk space is restored, system should return to normal file logging.
- How does the system handle very high logging volume that exceeds buffer capacity?
- What occurs when a log file is locked by another process?
- How does the system handle logging during critical system failures where even the logging system might be affected?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST initialize using the MetaLogger factory and support all configuration methods (code parameters, environment variables, CLI arguments) with proper priority order
- **FR-002**: System MUST support standard log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide specialized logging for trade events using structlog binders to separate them into trades.log
- **FR-004**: System MUST create and maintain three separate log files: expert.log (general events), trades.log (trade events), and errors.log (errors only)
- **FR-005**: System MUST support both human-readable text format for console and RFC 5424 structured JSON format for files and external systems
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement log rotation with configurable max file size (default 10MB) and backup count (default 5)
- **FR-007**: System MUST support contextual logging with automatic addition of domain-specific information (expert_name, symbol, trade_id, order_id, strategy_id, account_id)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support asynchronous logging to prevent blocking the main trading thread when enabled
- **FR-009**: System MUST be resilient to logging system failures and continue operating the trading expert even if logging fails
- **FR-012**: System MUST mask sensitive information including API keys and account details in all log outputs
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide API access to logging capabilities for use in trading strategy code through the MetaExpert logger property
- **FR-011**: Individual log operations MUST complete within 10ms under normal system load conditions (CPU <80%, memory <80%) on standard cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS t3.medium or equivalent) to ensure no impact on trading performance

### Key Entities

- **MetaLogger**: The main logger factory and configuration handler that sets up structlog with appropriate processors, formatters, and handlers
- **Log Configuration**: A Pydantic model that defines all configurable logging parameters with environment variable aliases and default values
- **Log Processors**: A chain of structlog processors that enrich, format, and route log entries appropriately
- **Log Handlers**: Specialized handlers for console output, file output, and asynchronous file output with rotation capabilities
- **Log Context**: Domain-specific contextual information (expert_name, symbol, trade_id, etc.) that gets automatically added to log entries
