# Research: Comprehensive Logging System

## Decision: Use structlog as the core logging library
**Rationale**: Structlog provides structured logging capabilities, excellent performance, and supports the contextual logging requirements specified in the feature spec. It also integrates well with the existing Python logging infrastructure and supports RFC 5424 compliant output.

## Decision: Implement asynchronous logging with asyncio.Queue
**Rationale**: Asyncio-based logging ensures that high-frequency log operations do not block the main trading thread, which is critical for maintaining trading performance. This approach aligns with the requirement for 10ms max latency on individual log operations.

## Decision: Separate log files by type (expert.log, trades.log, errors.log)
**Rationale**: This separation allows traders and system administrators to efficiently analyze different types of events without sifting through unrelated information. This meets the requirement for efficient monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Decision: Configuration via Pydantic models with environment variable support
**Rationale**: Using Pydantic models provides type safety, validation, and automatic environment variable integration which matches the spec requirement for configuration via multiple methods (code, environment variables, CLI arguments) with proper priority order.

## Decision: RFC 5424 compliant JSON format
**Rationale**: Following the RFC 5424 standard ensures compatibility with external log analysis tools and provides a consistent structured format for all JSON logs as required by the specification.
