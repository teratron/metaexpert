# Research for Comprehensive Logging System

## Overview
This document captures research findings and decisions for implementing the comprehensive logging system in MetaExpert. All requirements from the feature specification have been analyzed, and technical decisions have been documented.

## Technology Stack Research

### Primary Dependencies

1. **structlog**
   - Decision: Use structlog as the core logging library
   - Rationale: Provides structured logging capabilities with flexible processors and formatters, which is essential for meeting FR-005 (RFC 5424 structured JSON format). It's well-maintained, has good performance characteristics, and integrates well with Python's standard logging module.
   - Alternatives considered: 
     - Python's standard logging module alone (insufficient for structured logging needs)
     - loguru (more opinionated, less configurable for our specific needs)
     - custom solution (reinventing the wheel without benefit)

2. **Pydantic**
   - Decision: Use Pydantic for configuration models
   - Rationale: Provides robust validation, environment variable parsing, and type safety for configuration parameters. Aligns with project's OOP and quality principles. Essential for implementing FR-001 (configuration via multiple methods with priority order).
   - Alternatives considered:
     - Python dataclasses (less validation capabilities)
     - configparser (limited for complex configurations)
     - custom validation (more work without benefit)

3. **asyncio**
   - Decision: Use asyncio for asynchronous logging
   - Rationale: Essential for meeting FR-008 (asynchronous logging to prevent blocking main trading thread). Python's standard library solution with good performance characteristics.
   - Alternatives considered:
     - Third-party async libraries (unnecessary when asyncio is available)
     - Threading (higher overhead than asyncio)

4. **logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler**
   - Decision: Use RotatingFileHandler for log rotation
   - Rationale: Part of Python standard library, specifically designed for log rotation with size and count limits. Directly addresses FR-006 (log rotation with configurable max file size and backup count).
   - Alternatives considered:
     - TimedRotatingFileHandler (not needed for size-based rotation)
     - Custom rotation (redundant)

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Architecture Design
- Decision: Implement as a dedicated module following library-first architecture
- Rationale: Aligns with MetaExpert Constitution principle of library-first architecture. Provides clear separation of concerns and testability.
- Implementation: `src/metaexpert/logger/` package with dedicated modules

### 2. Log File Separation
- Decision: Use structlog's processor chains and custom handlers to route messages to different files
- Rationale: Enables different log types (expert.log, trades.log, errors.log) as required by FR-004
- Implementation: Different handlers for different logger names or with custom filtering logic

### 3. Performance Strategy
- Decision: Implement async logging with queue-based buffering
- Rationale: The 10ms requirement (FR-011) and 10,000 entries/second requirement (SC-002) require non-blocking I/O operations
- Implementation: asyncio.Queue for buffering, separate worker for file I/O

### 4. Contextual Logging
- Decision: Use structlog's bind functionality for contextual information
- Rationale: Provides structured context as required by FR-007 (expert_name, symbol, trade_id, etc.)
- Implementation: Context managers and processor chains to enrich log entries

### 5. Configuration Priority
- Decision: CLI > Environment Variables > Code (in that order)
- Rationale: Standard practice for configuration priority. Allows maximum flexibility as required by FR-001
- Implementation: Pydantic settings model with different configuration sources

### 6. Sensitive Data Masking
- Decision: Custom processor to filter sensitive information
- Rationale: Required by FR-012 (masking API keys and account details)
- Implementation: Processor to identify and redact sensitive fields in log messages

### 7. RFC 5424 Compliance
- Decision: Custom formatter implementing RFC 5424 structure
- Rationale: Required by FR-005 and SC-008 (structured JSON format requirements)
- Implementation: JSON formatter that follows RFC 5424 fields structure with our required fields

### 8. Error Resilience
- Decision: Graceful fallback mechanisms when logging fails
- Rationale: Required by FR-009 (continue operation when logging fails)
- Implementation: Try/catch blocks in handlers with fallback to console when file writing fails

## Performance Considerations

### 10ms Latency Requirement
- Research: Based on analysis of typical I/O operations and structlog performance, direct synchronous I/O will not meet the 10ms requirement during high load.
- Solution: Asynchronous logging with queue-based buffering to keep the main thread unblocked.

### Throughput Requirement (10,000 entries/second)
- Research: This is achievable with proper async implementation and good hardware (as specified in requirements).
- Solution: Batch writing and async processing to achieve required throughput.

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data Handling
- Research: Techniques for identifying and masking sensitive information in log streams
- Solution: Custom filtering processor that scans log entries and masks known sensitive fields

### File Permissions
- Research: Appropriate file permissions for log files containing sensitive data
- Solution: Set restrictive file permissions on log files to prevent unauthorized access

## Edge Cases Handling

### Disk Space Exhaustion
- Decision: Detect low disk space and switch to console-only mode
- Rationale: Required by the specification and edge case handling
- Implementation: Disk space monitoring before writing to files

### Concurrent Access
- Decision: Use appropriate locking mechanisms for multi-process access
- Rationale: Trading systems may run multiple experts that could try to write to logs
- Implementation: Safe file handlers with proper locking

## RFC 5424 Implementation Details

Based on requirement SC-008 and FR-005:
- Required fields: timestamp, severity, message, expert_name, symbol, trade_id, order_id, strategy_id, account_id
- Optional fields: function, file, line, exception_details
- Additional structlog-specific fields will be preserved where appropriate

## Integration with Existing Architecture

### MetaExpert Integration
- The logging system will be accessible via the main MetaExpert class as specified in FR-010
- Users can access the logger through the MetaExpert instance's logger property
- Configuration will be part of the main MetaExpert configuration

### CLI Integration
- Logging configuration parameters will be available through the CLI as specified in US4
- Will follow existing MetaExpert CLI patterns

## Testing Strategy

Based on the Test-First principle from the constitution:
- Unit tests for all components using pytest
- Integration tests for logger functionality
- Performance tests to verify the 10ms requirement
- Error resilience tests to verify FR-009
