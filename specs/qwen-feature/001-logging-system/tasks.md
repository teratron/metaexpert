## Phase 7: [US5] High-Performance Asynchronous Logging (Priority: P3)
- [ ] T043 [US5] Create asynchronous file handler in src/metaexpert/logger/handlers/file.py
- [ ] T044 [US5] Implement asyncio.Queue for buffering log entries
- [ ] T045 [US5] Add performance checks using pytest-benchmark to ensure 10ms latency requirement is met under various load conditions, with performance metrics captured and logged for monitoring
- [ ] T046 [US5] [P] Write unit tests for async logging
- [ ] T047 [US5] [P] Write performance tests for async logging

- [ ] T062 Add examples to quickstart guide
- [ ] T063 [P] Write documentation tests to verify examples work

## Dependencies & Execution Order
- User Story 1 (US1) must be completed before US2, US3, US4, and US5
- US2, US3, and US4 can be developed in parallel after US1 is complete
- US5 can be developed independently after US1, but integration testing requires US2 and US3

## Parallel Execution Opportunities
- T013-T015 can execute in parallel during US1
- T022-T023 can execute in parallel during US2
- T031-T033 can execute in parallel during US3
- T039-T040 can execute in parallel during US4
- T046-T047 can execute in parallel during US5
- T049-T054 can execute in parallel during cross-cutting phase

## Implementation Strategy (MVP First)
- MVP includes: US1 + basic US2 (no async, no structured logging)
- Subsequent releases: US3 (structured logging), US4 (config methods), US5 (async)
