# Feature Specification: MetaExpert Library Project Specification

**Feature Branch**: `feature/project-specification`  \n
**Created**: 2025-10-13  \n
**Status**: Draft  \n
**Input**: User description: "Create a complete project specification based on the current structure and architecture located in the @/src/metaexpert directory. Pay special attention to the file @/src/metaexpert/template/template.py , which should be used to create a template for the end developer using this library. The specification should contain a description of the architecture, interfaces, data structure, initialization processes, as well as instructions for integrating and using the template in third-party projects."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Template Usage (Priority: P1)

As a cryptocurrency trading developer, I want to use the MetaExpert template to quickly create my own trading strategy, so that I can focus on strategy logic rather than infrastructure setup.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables developers to leverage the library effectively. Without an easily usable template, the value of the entire library is diminished.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new strategy using the template, implementing basic logic, and successfully running it in paper trading mode.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer has installed MetaExpert library, **When** they use the template to create a new strategy, **Then** they get a working skeleton with all necessary components pre-configured
2. **Given** developer has the template, **When** they fill in their strategy parameters and logic, **Then** they can run the strategy successfully with minimal additional code changes

### User Story 2 - Multi-Exchange Trading (Priority: P2)

As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to deploy the same trading strategy across multiple exchanges without significant code changes, so that I can capitalize on opportunities across different platforms.

**Why this priority**: This provides the core value proposition of the library by offering a unified interface across exchanges.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by implementing a strategy that works on one exchange and verifying minimal code changes are needed to run it on another exchange.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a working strategy on one exchange, **When** trader configures it for another supported exchange, **Then** the same strategy logic executes with minimal parameter adjustments
2. **Given** trader has accounts on multiple exchanges, **When** they run the same strategy across exchanges, **Then** each exchange executes the strategy independently while maintaining unified configuration

---

### User Story 3 - Strategy Testing and Backtesting (Priority: P3)

As a trading strategy developer, I want to test my strategies in both paper trading and backtesting modes before going live, so that I can validate strategy effectiveness and minimize risk.

**Why this priority**: Testing capabilities are essential for strategy validation and risk management before live deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running a strategy in backtesting mode with historical data and verifying it executes trades according to defined rules.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer has a trading strategy, **When** they run it in backtesting mode, **Then** the system executes historical trades and provides performance metrics
2. **Given** developer has a strategy ready for live trading, **When** they run it in paper trading mode, **Then** it executes simulated trades using real market data without financial risk

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an exchange API is temporarily unavailable during live trading?
- How does the system handle rate limits exceeded during intensive operations?
- What occurs when market conditions change rapidly during order execution across different exchanges?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a template file that serves as a starting point for creating new trading strategies with all necessary configuration sections pre-defined
- **FR-002**: Template MUST include configuration sections for exchange connection parameters (API keys, testnet, proxy settings)
- **FR-003**: Template MUST include configuration sections for market and trading parameters (market type, contract type, margin mode, position mode)
- **FR-004**: Template MUST provide event handler functions with appropriate decorators (on_init, on_bar, on_tick, on_order, etc.)
- **FR-005**: System MUST support multiple exchange connections through a unified interface (Binance, Bybit, OKX, Bitget, KuCoin)
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to specify trade mode (paper, live, backtest) with appropriate parameters
- **FR-007**: System MUST support multiple trading types (spot, futures, options) and contract types (linear, inverse)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide comprehensive logging capabilities with configurable log levels and output destinations
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement risk management features including stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing controls
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle authentication for different exchanges with appropriate credential requirements (api_key, api_secret, api_passphrase)
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide backtesting capabilities with configurable date ranges and initial capital
- **FR-012**: System MUST implement rate limiting controls to prevent API abuse
- **FR-013**: System MUST persist state between runs when enabled in configuration
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide comprehensive error handling for network, API, and runtime errors
- **FR-015**: System MUST support multi-timeframe strategies with appropriate event handlers
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide portfolio management features including position tracking and account balance monitoring
- **FR-017**: System MUST support 1 strategy per instance to ensure clear resource allocation and easier debugging 
- **FR-018**: System MUST process most market data with <200ms latency, with exceptions for complex operations
- **FR-019**: System MUST store API credentials in environment variables only for security

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **MetaExpert**: Core trading system class that manages exchange connections, configuration and execution
- **MetaExchange**: Handles connections to various cryptocurrency exchanges with unified interface
- **MetaLogger**: Provides logging functionality for trading operations with multiple output destinations
- **MetaProcess**: Manages the trading process and execution with rate limiting and metrics
- **Event Handlers**: Decorated functions that respond to trading events (ticks, bars, orders, positions, etc.)
- **Strategy Configuration**: Parameters defining trading behavior, risk management, and execution settings

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: New developers can create and run a basic trading strategy from the template within 15 minutes
- **SC-002**: Users can switch between supported exchanges with fewer than 5 parameter changes
- **SC-003**: Backtesting mode can process 1 year of minute-level data in under 10 minutes on standard hardware
- **SC-004**: 95% of market data events are processed with less than 100ms latency
- **SC-005**: Risk management parameters prevent losses exceeding defined limits in 99% of simulated adverse scenarios
