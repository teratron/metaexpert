# Constitution Amendment: Unified Logging System

## Summary of Changes

This amendment adds a new principle to the MetaExpert Constitution to ensure consistent logging across all modules.

### Added Principle
- **VI. Unified Logging System**: All modules must integrate with the centralized logging system located at `src/metaexpert/logger`. Logging must be consistent across all components, utilizing structured logging formats where appropriate. All log messages must follow established severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and include contextual information to aid in debugging and monitoring.

### Updates Made
1. Updated `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the new principle and incremented version to 1.2.0
2. Updated `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` to include the new principle in the Constitution Check section
3. Updated `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` to include the new principle in the validation checklist

### Version Change
- **Previous Version**: 1.1.0
- **New Version**: 1.2.0
  - This is a MINOR version bump because we've added a new principle (Unified Logging System) to the constitution.

## Rationale
The addition of the Unified Logging System principle ensures that:
1. All modules in the MetaExpert library use a consistent logging approach
2. Debugging and monitoring capabilities are improved across the entire system
3. Log messages include sufficient contextual information for effective troubleshooting
4. Structured logging formats are utilized for better log analysis and processing

This change aligns with the existing Observability & Versioning principle and strengthens the overall observability of the MetaExpert system.
