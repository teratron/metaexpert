# Research: Exception Handling Module

## Overview
This document outlines the research findings for implementing a dedicated exceptions module in the MetaExpert library. The goal is to create a well-structured, logically organized module for handling custom errors specific to the library.

## Decision
Create a new `exceptions.py` module in the `src/metaexpert` directory that follows Python best practices for exception handling. The module will include:
1. A base exception class that inherits from Python's built-in Exception class
2. Specific exception classes for different error conditions in the library
3. Proper integration with existing components

## Rationale
1. **Current State**: The library currently handles errors using generic Python exceptions and logging, but lacks a structured approach to custom exceptions.
2. **Best Practices**: Python libraries typically provide custom exception hierarchies to allow users to handle specific error conditions appropriately.
3. **Integration**: The new module will integrate seamlessly with existing components without breaking changes.
4. **Maintainability**: A centralized exceptions module will make it easier to manage and extend error handling in the future.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Keep using generic exceptions**: Continue using generic Python exceptions like ValueError, RuntimeError, etc.
   - Rejected because it doesn't provide the specificity needed for library users to handle different error conditions appropriately.

2. **Distribute exceptions across modules**: Place exception classes in the modules where they are used.
   - Rejected because it would make error handling inconsistent and harder to manage.

3. **Create multiple exception modules**: Create separate modules for different categories of exceptions.
   - Rejected because the library is not large enough to warrant multiple exception modules at this time.

## Research Findings
1. **Python Exception Hierarchy**: Python's built-in exceptions form a hierarchy with `BaseException` at the top and `Exception` as the base class for all built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions.
2. **Library Design Patterns**: Well-designed Python libraries typically have a single exceptions module that contains all custom exception classes.
3. **Integration Patterns**: Custom exceptions should integrate with existing error handling without requiring changes to existing code.

## Implementation Approach
1. **Base Exception Class**: Create a `MetaExpertError` class that inherits from `Exception` as the base for all custom exceptions.
2. **Specific Exception Classes**: Create specific exception classes for different error categories:
   - Configuration errors
   - API errors
   - Trading errors
   - Data validation errors
3. **Documentation**: Provide clear docstrings for each exception class explaining when it should be raised and how to handle it.
4. **Testing**: Create unit tests for each exception class to ensure proper behavior.

## Technical Considerations
1. **Backward Compatibility**: The new exceptions module should not break existing functionality.
2. **Import Structure**: The module should be easily importable from the main package.
3. **Error Messages**: Exception messages should be clear and helpful to library users.
