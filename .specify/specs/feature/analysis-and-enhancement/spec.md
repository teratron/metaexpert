# Feature Specification: MetaExpert Library Template Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `feature/analysis-and-enhancement`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "The template.py file is the primary (reference) template for the MetaExpert library, copied into a user's project when the metaexpert new or metaexpert --new command is executed. This file must not be modified without explicit approval from the library owner. For every new task, the AI agent must verify that its actions and outputs do not conflict with the structure, parameters, or functionality defined in template.py."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the MetaExpert library, I want to create a new trading strategy by using the template.py file so that I can quickly set up a working expert advisor with all the necessary configuration options and event handlers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer wants to create a new trading strategy, **When** they run the `metaexpert new` command, **Then** the template.py file is copied to their project with all configuration options and event handlers intact.
2. **Given** a developer has created a new trading strategy from the template, **When** they modify the template according to their strategy needs, **Then** the expert advisor runs correctly without conflicts with the core MetaExpert library structure.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a developer modifies core configuration parameters in the template?
- How does system handle template files that have been modified from the original structure?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a template.py file that serves as the starting point for creating trading strategies.
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure the template.py file contains all necessary configuration options for connecting to supported exchanges.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to configure API credentials for live trading mode.
- **FR-004**: System MUST include all standard event handlers (on_init, on_deinit, on_tick, on_bar, etc.) in the template.
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve the structure, parameters, and functionality of template.py when copied to user projects.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow developers to customize strategy-specific parameters in the template.
- **FR-007**: System MUST support all currently supported exchanges (Binance, Bybit, OKX, Bitget, Kucoin).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Template File**: The template.py file that serves as the base for all new trading strategies.
- **Configuration Parameters**: All the parameters that define how the expert advisor connects to exchanges and operates.
- **Event Handlers**: The functions that handle different events in the trading lifecycle.
