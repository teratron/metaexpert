# Workspace Cleanup Summary

## Issue Identified
There were two directories with similar content causing confusion:
1. `.specify/specs/feature/analysis-and-enhancement/` - The correct, git-tracked directory
2. `specs/` - An untracked duplicate directory

## Action Taken
Removed the duplicate `specs/` directory to maintain a clean workspace and avoid confusion.

## Current State
- Working directory: `.specify/specs/feature/analysis-and-enhancement/`
- Branch: `001-analysis-and-enhancement`
- Modified files: 5 files with ongoing changes
- New files: 4 untracked files with new content
- Duplicate directory: Removed

## Next Steps
Continue working with the files in the correct directory, focusing on:
1. The modified files that need to be staged and committed
2. The new files that need to be reviewed and added to git

This cleanup ensures we're working with the correct files and avoids any potential conflicts or confusion between duplicate directories.
