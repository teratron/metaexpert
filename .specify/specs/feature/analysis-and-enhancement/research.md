# Research: MetaExpert Library Template Enhancement

## Decision: Template Structure and Implementation Approach
The template.py file should maintain its current structure while ensuring all configuration options and event handlers are properly documented and organized.

## Rationale
1. The existing template structure has been proven to work well for developers creating trading strategies
2. Maintaining consistency with the current structure reduces the learning curve for new users
3. The clear organization of configuration options and event handlers makes it easy for developers to understand and modify

## Alternatives Considered
1. Completely redesigning the template structure - Rejected because it would break compatibility with existing user code
2. Simplifying the template by removing less commonly used options - Rejected because it would limit the flexibility for advanced users
3. Creating multiple templates for different use cases - Rejected because it would complicate the new command and increase maintenance overhead

## Exchange API Integration Research
1. **Binance**: Well-documented API with extensive support for spot, futures, and options trading
2. **Bybit**: Strong API with support for spot and futures trading
3. **OKX**: Comprehensive API with support for spot, futures, and options trading
4. **Bitget**: Solid API with focus on futures trading
5. **Kucoin**: Good API support for spot and futures trading

All exchanges support the required functionality for the MetaExpert library.

## Event Handler Patterns
The current event handler pattern using decorators is clear and follows Python best practices:
- @expert.on_init for initialization
- @expert.on_deinit for cleanup
- @expert.on_tick for real-time price updates
- @expert.on_bar for completed bar notifications
- etc.

This pattern should be maintained for consistency.

## Configuration Parameter Organization
The current organization of configuration parameters into logical groups is effective:
- Core configuration parameters
- API credentials
- Connection settings
- Market and trading mode settings
- Logging configuration
- Advanced system settings

This organization should be maintained for clarity.
