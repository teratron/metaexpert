# Checklist: Logging Configuration Requirements

**Purpose**: To validate that all configuration-related requirements for the logging system are clear, complete, and unambiguous before implementation begins. This checklist is intended for developer self-assessment.
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Feature**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001: Are the default values for all logging parameters (`log_level`, `log_file`, `structured_logging`, etc.) explicitly defined in the requirements? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK002: Does the specification include requirements for configuring log file rotation (max size, backup count)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK003: Is the configuration parameter for the `webhook_url` explicitly documented as a requirement? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK004: Are requirements for all configuration parameters exposed in the `MetaExpert` constructor documented? [Gap]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005: Is the priority order for applying configuration sources (e.g., CLI > Constructor > Env > Defaults) stated unambiguously? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK006: Are the data types and the exact set of allowed string values (e.g., `log_level` must be one of 'DEBUG', 'INFO', etc.) specified for each configuration parameter? [Clarity, Gap]
- [ ] CHK007: Does the spec clarify how `structured_logging=True` should affect the console output format? (e.g., should the console remain human-readable regardless of this setting?) [Clarity, Ambiguity]
- [ ] CHK008: Is it clearly specified whether the paths for log files (`log_file`, `trade_log_file`, etc.) are absolute paths or relative to a specific project directory? [Clarity, Gap]

## Scenario & Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK009: Does the spec define the system's behavior if conflicting configurations are provided from different sources (e.g., `log_level` set in both the constructor and a CLI argument)? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK010: Is the required behavior defined for when an invalid value is provided for a configuration parameter (e.g., `log_level="VERBOSE"`)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK011: Does the spec clarify what should happen if `structured_logging` is `False` but a `webhook_url` is provided, given that webhooks typically require a structured (JSON) payload? [Edge Case, Gap]
- [ ] CHK012: Are there requirements defining the behavior if a log file path is configured to be a directory that does not exist or is not writable? [Edge Case, Gap]

## Consistency & Dependencies

- [ ] CHK013: Are the configuration parameter names used in the `MetaExpert` constructor consistent with the names used in the `template.py` and documentation? [Consistency, Gap]
- [ ] CHK014: Does the specification for configuration align with the capabilities of the chosen core library (`structlog`)? [Dependency]
