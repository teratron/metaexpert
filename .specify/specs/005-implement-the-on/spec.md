# Feature Specification: Implement on_init Handler for Expert Loading

**Feature Branch**: `005-implement-the-on`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement the on_init handler in src/metaexpert/_expert.py and src/metaexpert/service.py to process the on_init event triggered upon expert loading. The handler should support void or int return types, with no parameters (def on_init() -> None | int). Non-zero return values indicate failed initialization, triggering a on_deinit event with reason REASON_INITFAILED. Use an ENUM_INIT_RETCODE-style enumeration (INIT_SUCCEEDED, INIT_FAILED, INIT_PARAMETERS_INCORRECT, INIT_AGENT_NOT_SUITABLE) to manage initialization outcomes, optimize testing agent selection (e.g., via system resource checks), and ensure compatibility with template.py. Update documentation in @/docs/ with English docstrings."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the MetaExpert library, I want to implement custom initialization logic in my trading strategy that can indicate success or failure, so that I can properly set up my strategy before trading begins and handle initialization failures gracefully.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a trading strategy with an on_init handler that returns None, **When** the expert is loaded, **Then** the initialization is considered successful and trading proceeds normally.
2. **Given** a trading strategy with an on_init handler that returns 0, **When** the expert is loaded, **Then** the initialization is considered successful and trading proceeds normally.
3. **Given** a trading strategy with an on_init handler that returns a non-zero value, **When** the expert is loaded, **Then** the initialization is considered failed, the on_deinit handler is called with REASON_INITFAILED, and trading does not proceed.
4. **Given** a trading strategy without an on_init handler, **When** the expert is loaded, **Then** the initialization is considered successful and trading proceeds normally.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the on_init handler raises an exception?
- How does the system handle different non-zero return values?
- What happens if the on_init handler takes parameters (which it shouldn't)?
- How does the system handle initialization when system resources are insufficient?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow developers to implement an on_init handler in their trading strategies
- **FR-002**: System MUST support on_init handlers with no parameters
- **FR-003**: System MUST support on_init handlers with return types of None or int
- **FR-004**: System MUST treat None or 0 return values as successful initialization
- **FR-005**: System MUST treat non-zero return values as failed initialization
- **FR-006**: System MUST trigger the on_deinit handler with REASON_INITFAILED when initialization fails
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide an ENUM_INIT_RETCODE-style enumeration with values INIT_SUCCEEDED, INIT_FAILED, INIT_PARAMETERS_INCORRECT, INIT_AGENT_NOT_SUITABLE
- **FR-008**: System MUST be compatible with the existing template.py structure
- **FR-009**: System MUST include proper English documentation in the docs directory

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **on_init Handler**: A function that runs when an expert is loaded, allowing developers to perform initialization tasks
- **Initialization Return Code**: An enumeration value that indicates the success or failure of initialization
- **REASON_INITFAILED**: A constant that indicates initialization failure as the reason for deinitialization
