# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice

The tone and voice for MetaExpert's documentation and communications should be a blend of professional, technical, and educational.

*   **Professional and Technical:** All content must be precise, accurate, and provide detailed technical explanations to cater to an audience of developers and trading professionals.
*   **Accessible and Educational:** While maintaining technical depth, the content should also be clear, simple, and aim to guide users through complex concepts, making the platform approachable for those still learning.

## Visual Identity

The visual identity should incorporate elements that are data-driven, minimalist, modern, and sleek, while remaining simple and unbranded.

*   **Data-Driven and Minimalist:** The primary focus of any visual elements, such as charts or diagrams, should be on the clear and accurate representation of data. A minimalist aesthetic with a clean layout and minimal color palette is preferred.
*   **Modern and Sleek:** Employ a modern design aesthetic with clean lines, potentially a dark theme, and selective use of vibrant accent colors to create a contemporary and visually appealing experience.
*   **Simple and Unbranded:** The project will stick to standard markdown and code block styling. This approach prioritizes content and readability over a heavy visual brand, ensuring ease of maintenance and a consistent experience across different platforms.
